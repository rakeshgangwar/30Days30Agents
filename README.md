# 30 AI Agents in 30 Days

Welcome to my ambitious project where I'll be building 30 different AI agents in 30 consecutive days. This project serves as both a learning experience and a practical exploration of various AI agent frameworks, capabilities, and use cases.

## Project Overview

In this challenge, I'll create one new AI agent each day for 30 days. Each agent will focus on a specific task, capability, or domain, allowing me to explore different aspects of AI agent development while building a diverse portfolio of practical applications.

## Project Goals

- Learn and experiment with different AI agent frameworks and technologies
- Build practical, useful AI agents that solve real problems
- Document the development process, challenges, and learnings
- Create a showcase of diverse AI capabilities and applications
- Establish a foundation for more complex AI projects in the future

## Project Structure

Each day's agent will be organized in its own directory following this structure:

```
/Day-XX-AgentName/
  ├── README.md       # Description, features, and usage instructions
  ├── requirements.txt # Dependencies
  ├── main.py         # Main implementation
  ├── config.py       # Configuration settings
  ├── utils/          # Helper functions and utilities
  └── assets/         # Any additional resources
```

## Technical Requirements

### Core Technologies

- **Python** - Primary programming language
- **LangChain/LlamaIndex** - Agent frameworks
- **OpenAI API / Anthropic API / Local LLMs** - Foundation models
- **Streamlit/Gradio** - Simple UI development
- **Vector Databases** - For knowledge storage (Chroma, Pinecone, etc.)
- **Hugging Face Transformers** - For specialized models

### Development Environment

- Python 3.9+ environment
- Git for version control
- Virtual environment management (venv, conda)
- API keys for various services

## Preparation Checklist

### Before Starting
- [ ] Set up GitHub repository structure
- [ ] Create project templates for consistency
- [ ] Obtain necessary API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Research agent frameworks and architectures
- [ ] Create a project tracking system
- [ ] Define evaluation criteria for each agent

### Daily Workflow
1. Plan the day's agent (requirements, features, architecture)
2. Implement core functionality
3. Test and refine
4. Document the process and learnings
5. Publish and share progress

## Learning Resources

### Agent Frameworks
- LangChain documentation
- LlamaIndex documentation
- AutoGPT and BabyAGI repositories
- CrewAI documentation
- Microsoft Semantic Kernel

### Courses and Tutorials
- DeepLearning.AI courses on LLMs
- Hugging Face courses
- YouTube tutorials on agent development

### Communities

# 30 AI Agents in 30 Days

Welcome to my ambitious project where I'll be building 30 different AI agents in 30 consecutive days. This project serves as both a learning experience and a practical exploration of various AI agent frameworks, capabilities, and use cases.

## Project Overview

In this challenge, I'll create one new AI agent each day for 30 days. Each agent will focus on a specific task, capability, or domain, allowing me to explore different aspects of AI agent development while building a diverse portfolio of practical applications.

## Project Goals

- Learn and experiment with different AI agent frameworks and technologies
- Build practical, useful AI agents that solve real problems
- Document the development process, challenges, and learnings
- Create a showcase of diverse AI capabilities and applications
- Establish a foundation for more complex AI projects in the future

## Project Structure

The project is currently organized as follows:

```

      └── tools.md
```

The project is currently in the planning and specification phase. As implementation progresses, each agent directory will be populated with the following structure:

```
/Day-XX-AgentName/
  ├── README.md         # Documentation, features, and usage instructions
  ├── agent-spec.md     # Agent specification and requirements
  ├── requirements.txt  # Dependencies
  ├── main.py           # Main implementation
  ├── config.py         # Configuration settings
  ├── utils/            # Helper functions and utilities
  └── assets/           # Additional resources (images, datasets, etc.)
```

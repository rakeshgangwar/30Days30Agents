# AI Agent Frameworks

This document provides an overview of the major AI agent frameworks that can be used for the "30 AI Agents in 30 Days" project. Each framework has its own strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases.

## LangChain

### Overview
LangChain is one of the most popular frameworks for building applications with large language models (LLMs). It provides a standardized interface for chains, a collection of components for working with language models, and end-to-end chains for common applications.

### Key Features
- **Chains**: Combine multiple components together for complex workflows
- **Agents**: Create autonomous agents that can use tools and make decisions
- **Memory**: Implement various memory types for contextual conversations
- **Tools**: Integrate with external tools and APIs
- **Callbacks**: Track and log the internal states of chains and agents
- **Document loaders**: Import various document formats
- **Text splitters**: Chunk documents for processing
- **Retrievers & Vector stores**: Implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

### Best For
- General-purpose agent development
- Complex workflows with multiple steps
- Applications requiring tool use and reasoning
- Projects needing integration with many external services

### Code Example
```python
from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# Initialize the language model
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

# Load tools for the agent to use
tools = load_tools(["serpapi", "llm-math"], llm=llm)

# Initialize the agent with the tools and language model
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True
)

# Run the agent
agent.run("What was the high temperature in SF yesterday? What is that number raised to the .023 power?")
```

- Projects where data context is critical

### Code Example
```python
from llama_index import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader
from llama_index.agent import ReActAgent
from llama_index.llms import OpenAI

# Load documents
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("./data").load_data()

# Create index
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)

# Create query engine
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()

# Create agent
llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo")
agent = ReActAgent.from_tools(
    [query_engine], llm=llm, verbose=True
)

## CrewAI

### Overview
CrewAI is a framework for orchestrating role-playing autonomous AI agents. It focuses on enabling multiple agents to work together as a cohesive team, each with specific roles and responsibilities.

### Key Features
- **Agent roles**: Define specialized roles for different agents
- **Tasks**: Create structured tasks for agents to complete
- **Processes**: Define how agents collaborate (sequential, hierarchical, etc.)
- **Delegation**: Agents can delegate subtasks to other agents
- **Memory sharing**: Agents can share context and knowledge

### Best For
- Multi-agent systems where specialization is important
- Projects requiring collaboration between different agent types
- Complex tasks that benefit from division of labor
- Simulating team dynamics and organizational structures

### Code Example
```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# Define the OpenAI language model
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)

# Create agents with different roles
researcher = Agent(
    role="Senior Research Analyst",
    goal="Uncover cutting-edge developments in AI technology",
    backstory="You are an expert in AI with a knack for identifying emerging trends.",
    verbose=True,
    llm=llm
)

writer = Agent(
    role="Tech Content Strategist",
    goal="Create engaging content about AI advancements",
    backstory="You transform complex technical concepts into compelling narratives.",
    verbose=True,
    llm=llm
)

# Create tasks for the agents
research_task = Task(
    description="Research the latest developments in generative AI over the last 3 months.",
    agent=researcher
)

writing_task = Task(
    description="Write a 2-paragraph summary about the most significant generative AI advancements.",
    agent=writer,
    context=[research_task]
)

# Create a crew with the agents and tasks
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[research_task, writing_task],
    verbose=2
)

# Start the crew's work
result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```

## AutoGPT

### Overview
AutoGPT is an experimental open-source application that showcases the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. It chains together LLM calls to autonomously achieve goals defined by the user.

### Key Features
- **Autonomous goal pursuit**: Works toward user-defined goals with minimal intervention
- **Long-term memory**: Maintains context across many interactions
- **Internet access**: Can search the web for information
- **File operations**: Can read and write files
- **Self-prompting**: Generates its own prompts for the next steps

### Best For
- Highly autonomous tasks
- Exploratory projects where the path to the goal isn't clearly defined
- Tasks requiring creative problem-solving
- Projects where the agent needs to adapt its approach based on findings

### Code Example (Using AutoGPT's Python Library)
```python
from autogpt import AutoGPT
from autogpt.config import Config
from autogpt.memory import LocalCache

# Configure AutoGPT
config = Config()
config.continuous_mode = False
config.temperature = 0.7

# Initialize memory
memory = LocalCache(config)

# Create the AutoGPT instance
agent = AutoGPT(config, memory)

# Set the agent's goals
goals = [
    "Research the impact of AI on healthcare",
    "Write a summary report of findings",
    "Identify 3 potential AI applications in preventive care"
]

# Run the agent
agent.run(goals)
```

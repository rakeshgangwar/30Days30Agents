## Code Structure

Implement specialized agents with this structure:
```
/Day-XX-AgentName/
  ├── main.py           # Entry point
  ├── agent.py          # Core agent logic
  ├── knowledge/        # Domain-specific knowledge
  ├── apis/             # External API integrations
  ├── models/           # Data models
  ├── personalization/  # User preference handling
  ├── utils/            # Utility functions
  ├── ui/               # User interface components

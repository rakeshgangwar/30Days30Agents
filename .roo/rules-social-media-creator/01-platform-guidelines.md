2. **Features & Capabilities Thread** (2-3 tweets):
   - Key functionalities of the agent
   - Technical highlights without overwhelming jargon
   - Example use cases or scenarios
   - Visual elements where possible (screenshots, diagrams)

3. **Technical Insight Tweet**:
   - One interesting implementation detail or challenge

## Notes and Decisions

### 2023-06-XX - Architecture Decision
- Decided to switch from the current Streamlit implementation to the originally planned FastAPI + React architecture
- Existing Streamlit code will be used as a reference for business logic and functionality
- Backend will be implemented first, focusing on the core API endpoints
- Frontend development can begin in parallel once the API contract is defined
- The transition will require significant refactoring but will result in a more maintainable and scalable application

### 2023-06-XX - FastAPI Backend Implementation
- Completed the FastAPI backend implementation with all core endpoints
- Used uv package manager for project initialization and dependency management
- Implemented the ChatOpenRouter class that extends ChatOpenAI for OpenRouter integration
- Created services for CSV handling, database connections, and visualization generation
- Added Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Configured CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
- Tested the API endpoints using Swagger UI

### 2023-06-XX - React Frontend Implementation
- Completed the React frontend implementation with all core components
- Used pnpm for project initialization and dependency management
- Created a responsive UI with Material-UI components
- Implemented state management with React Context API
- Added CSV file upload and database connection components
- Created natural language query input and results display components
- Integrated Plotly for data visualization
- Implemented API service for backend communication

# Data Analysis Agent - Task Tracker

This document tracks the remaining tasks for the Data Analysis Agent project, based on the implementation plan and current project state.

## Architecture Decision

✅ **Decision**: Switch to FastAPI + React as originally planned

This decision has been made to align with the original implementation plan and to gain the benefits of:
- Better separation of concerns between frontend and backend
- More flexibility in UI design and user experience
- Improved performance and scalability
- Proper API-based architecture for better integration possibilities

  - [ ] Enhance error messages for database connection failures
  - [ ] Add better error recovery mechanisms
  - [ ] Implement more comprehensive logging

- [ ] **Code Organization**
  - [ ] Reorganize code into modules in the Day-05-Data-Analysis-Agent directory instead of keeping everything in the app folder

    - [ ] `/db/connect` - For establishing database connections
    - [ ] `/db/query` - For running natural language queries on SQL databases
  - [ ] Implement CORS handling
  - [ ] Add proper request/response models with Pydantic

- [ ] **Develop React Frontend**
  - [ ] Set up React project with TypeScript and Vite
  - [ ] Implement core components:
    - [ ] `DataSourceSelection` - Choose between CSV and DB
    - [ ] `CSVUpload` - Handle file uploads
    - [ ] `DBConnection` - Manage database connections
    - [ ] `QueryInput` - Input natural language queries
    - [ ] `ResultsDisplay` - Show results and visualizations
  - [ ] Add state management with React Context API
  - [ ] Implement API service for backend communication

- [ ] **Integration**
  - [ ] Connect React frontend with FastAPI backend
  - [ ] Ensure proper data flow between components
  - [ ] Test end-to-end user flows

## Low Priority Tasks (Stretch Goals)

- [ ] **Local LLM Integration**
  - [ ] Add Ollama support in backend
  - [ ] Implement LLM selection option in UI
  - [ ] Create switching logic between OpenRouter and local LLM

- [ ] **Enhanced Visualization Options**
  - [ ] Add support for more Plotly chart types
  - [ ] Implement visualization customization options
  - [ ] Add ability to save or export visualizations

- [ ] **Excel File Support**
  - [ ] Add Excel file processing in the backend
  - [ ] Update file upload component to accept .xlsx files
  - [ ] Test with sample Excel files

- [ ] **Code View & Export**
  - [ ] Expose generated Python/SQL code in the API response
  - [ ] Add a code viewer component in the UI
  - [ ] Implement code copy/export functionality

## Testing Tasks

- [ ] **Backend Testing**
  - [ ] Create unit tests for core functionality
  - [ ] Test with sample CSV files and databases
  - [ ] Implement integration tests for LLM interactions

- [ ] **Frontend Testing** (if using React)
  - [ ] Add component tests
  - [ ] Test form validations and user interactions
  - [ ] Ensure responsive design works on different screen sizes

- [ ] **End-to-End Testing**
  - [ ] Test complete user flows
  - [ ] Verify error handling and edge cases
  - [ ] Test with various query types and data sources

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Core backend setup with project structure
- [x] LLM integration with OpenRouter
- [x] CSV file handling with Pandas
- [x] SQL database connection and query execution
- [x] Basic visualization generation
- [x] Streamlit UI implementation

## Notes and Decisions

### 2023-06-XX - Architecture Decision
- Decided to switch from the current Streamlit implementation to the originally planned FastAPI + React architecture
- Existing Streamlit code will be used as a reference for business logic and functionality
- Backend will be implemented first, focusing on the core API endpoints
- Frontend development can begin in parallel once the API contract is defined
- The transition will require significant refactoring but will result in a more maintainable and scalable application

# Day 5: Data Analysis Agent

## Agent Purpose
Helps users analyze and visualize data from various sources (e.g., CSV files), generating insights, answering questions about the data, and creating basic visualizations.

## Key Features
- Data loading from files (e.g., CSV)
- Basic data cleaning and preprocessing
- Descriptive statistics calculation
- Data querying using natural language
- Generation of simple visualizations (bar charts, line plots, scatter plots)
- Interpretation of analysis results

## Example Queries
- "Load this CSV file and show me the first 5 rows."
- "What are the mean and median values for the 'Sales' column?"
- "Show me a histogram of the 'Age' column."
- "Is there a correlation between 'Marketing Spend' and 'Revenue'?"
- "Generate a bar chart showing sales per region."
- "Filter the data for customers in 'California'."

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: LangChain (potentially using Pandas DataFrame Agent) or AutoGen
- **Model**: GPT-4
- **Tools**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn (for basic analysis)
- **UI**: Streamlit or Gradio

## Possible Integrations
- Database connectors (SQLAlchemy)
- Spreadsheet software (Google Sheets API, Excel libraries)
- Business Intelligence tools

## Architecture Considerations

### Input Processing
- Parsing natural language queries to understand analytical intent
- Handling file uploads (CSV initially)
- Identifying column names and data types mentioned in queries
- Translating natural language questions into executable code (e.g., Pandas commands)

### Knowledge Representation
- In-memory representation of data using Pandas DataFrames
- Metadata about the dataset (column names, types, basic stats)
- Storing generated visualizations or analysis results

### Decision Logic
- Determining the appropriate analysis method based on the query (statistical summary, visualization, filtering, correlation)
- Selecting the right type of visualization for the data and query
- Generating executable code (e.g., Python/Pandas) to perform the analysis
- Interpreting the code output to provide a natural language summary

### Tool Integration
- Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for generating plots
- LLM for translating natural language to code and interpreting results
- File system access for loading data

### Output Formatting
- Displaying data tables (e.g., head, tail, filtered results)
- Presenting statistical summaries clearly
- Embedding generated plots directly in the UI
- Providing natural language explanations of the findings

### Memory Management
- Managing potentially large datasets in memory (consider chunking or sampling for very large files)
- Caching analysis results or generated plots for repeated queries
- Session-based memory of the loaded dataset and previous analysis steps

### Error Handling
- Handling errors during file loading or parsing (e.g., incorrect format, missing values)
- Managing errors from the execution of generated code (e.g., invalid Pandas operations)
- Providing informative feedback when a query cannot be understood or executed
- Dealing with missing or unclean data

## Implementation Flow
1. User uploads a data file (e.g., CSV) or points to a data source.
2. Agent loads and performs initial inspection of the data.
3. User asks a question or requests an analysis/visualization in natural language.
4. Agent translates the request into executable code (e.g., Pandas).
5. Agent executes the code to perform the analysis or generate a plot.
6. Agent interprets the code's output (data, stats, or plot).
7. Agent presents the results (table, text summary, visualization) to the user.

## Scaling Considerations
- Using libraries like Dask or Polars for handling larger-than-memory datasets
- Integrating with cloud-based data warehouses or data lakes
- Implementing more advanced statistical modeling or machine learning capabilities
- Supporting streaming data analysis

## Limitations
- Limited to the capabilities of the integrated libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib).
- May struggle with highly complex or ambiguous natural language queries.
- Code generation is not guaranteed to be correct or optimal.
- Security risks if generated code execution is not properly sandboxed.
- Initial version limited to specific file types (e.g., CSV).

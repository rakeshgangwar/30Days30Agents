# Day 11: Recipe Generator Agent

## Agent Purpose
Generates personalized recipes based on available ingredients, dietary restrictions, cuisine preferences, cooking time, and skill level. Can also help with meal planning.

## Key Features
- Recipe generation from ingredients list
- Filtering by dietary needs (vegetarian, gluten-free, allergies)
- Filtering by cuisine type, meal type (breakfast, dinner), difficulty
- Adjusting serving sizes
- Generating shopping lists based on selected recipes
- Basic meal planning suggestions

## Example Queries
- "What can I make with chicken breast, broccoli, and rice?"
- "Give me a vegan dinner recipe that takes under 30 minutes."
- "Generate a recipe for gluten-free chocolate chip cookies."
- "Create a weekly meal plan for two people, focusing on Italian cuisine."
- "Adjust this pasta recipe for 4 servings."
- "Create a shopping list for these three recipes."

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: LangChain
- **Model**: GPT-4 or Claude-2
- **Tools**: Web search (optional, for finding existing recipes to adapt), RAG on a recipe database (optional)
- **Storage**: Database (optional, for saving favorite recipes or user profiles)
- **UI**: Streamlit or web application

## Possible Integrations
- Recipe APIs (e.g., Spoonacular, Edamam)
- Grocery store APIs (for checking ingredient availability or ordering)
- Nutrition analysis APIs
- Smart kitchen appliances

## Architecture Considerations

### Input Processing
- Parsing user requests including ingredients, dietary restrictions, cuisine, time constraints, etc.
- Identifying ingredients from a list or natural language description
- Understanding requests for meal plans or shopping lists

### Knowledge Representation
- LLM's internal knowledge of cooking and recipes
- Optional: Structured recipe database with ingredients, instructions, nutritional info, metadata (cuisine, difficulty)
- User profile with dietary preferences, allergies, favorite cuisines, skill level

### Decision Logic
- Recipe generation logic based on constraints (ingredients, diet, time, etc.)
- Ingredient substitution logic (if an ingredient is missing)
- Serving size adjustment calculations
- Meal planning algorithm considering variety, nutritional balance, and user preferences
- Shopping list aggregation from multiple recipes

### Tool Integration
- LLM for core recipe generation and adaptation
- Optional: Recipe database/API for retrieving or validating recipes
- Web search for finding specific techniques or ingredient information
- Unit conversion tools (e.g., cups to grams)

### Output Formatting
- Recipes presented clearly with ingredient list and step-by-step instructions
- Nutritional information (estimated, if possible)
- Cooking time and difficulty level indicated
- Structured meal plans (e.g., by day and meal)
- Shopping lists organized by category (produce, dairy, etc.)

### Memory Management
- Storing user dietary preferences and allergies
- Saving user's favorite or generated recipes
- Remembering ingredients available in the user's pantry (if tracked)
- Session memory for multi-turn recipe refinement

### Error Handling
- Handling impossible requests (e.g., making a specific dish with completely wrong ingredients)
- Managing conflicting constraints (e.g., vegan and requires cheese)
- Providing safe cooking instructions (warnings about heat, raw ingredients)
- Dealing with unavailable information (e.g., specific nutritional data)
- Offering substitutions when exact ingredients aren't available

## Implementation Flow
1. User specifies ingredients, preferences, or requests a meal plan/recipe type.
2. Agent parses the request and accesses user profile/preferences if available.
3. Agent uses LLM (potentially with RAG or tools) to generate or find suitable recipes matching the criteria.
4. Agent adjusts serving size or makes substitutions if requested/necessary.
5. Agent formats the recipe(s) with ingredients and instructions.
6. If requested, agent generates a meal plan or shopping list.
7. Agent presents the output to the user.

## Scaling Considerations
- Building and maintaining a large, high-quality recipe database
- Integrating real-time nutritional analysis
- Personalizing recipes based on detailed user feedback and ratings
- Supporting complex meal planning with leftover management

## Limitations
- Generated recipes might not always be perfectly balanced or tasty.
- Instructions might lack crucial details or assume prior knowledge.
- Nutritional information is often an estimate.
- Ingredient substitutions might significantly alter the dish.
- Cannot guarantee food safety; users must follow standard safe cooking practices.

# Day 23: Job Search Assistant Agent

## Agent Purpose
Helps users find relevant job openings based on their skills, experience, and preferences. Can also assist with tailoring resumes/cover letters and preparing for interviews.

## Key Features
- Job searching across multiple platforms (LinkedIn, Indeed, specific company career pages)
- Filtering jobs based on criteria (location, salary, keywords, experience level)
- Matching user resume/profile against job descriptions
- Suggesting relevant skills to add or highlight
- Generating tailored resume bullet points or cover letter paragraphs
- Providing common interview questions for a specific role/company
- Summarizing job descriptions

## Example Queries/Tasks
- "Find remote software engineer jobs requiring Python and AWS."
- "Show me marketing manager roles in London paying over Â£60,000."
- "Does my resume match well with this job description? [Resume text/file + Job description text/link]"
- "Suggest skills I should learn for a data scientist role."
- "Help me write a cover letter paragraph about my project management experience for [Company Name]."
- "What are common interview questions for a product manager at Google?"
- "Summarize the key responsibilities for this job posting: [link]."

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: LangChain or CrewAI
- **Model**: GPT-4 or Claude-2/3
- **Tools**: Job board APIs (if available), Web scraping tools (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy - use ethically), Web search, Document loaders (for resume), Text comparison/matching libraries (e.g., TF-IDF, embeddings)
- **Storage**: Database (for user profile, skills, resume versions, saved jobs)
- **UI**: Streamlit, Web application

## Possible Integrations
- LinkedIn API (for profile data and job applications)
- ATS (Applicant Tracking System) APIs (less common for personal use)
- Calendar API (for scheduling interview prep time)
- Document editing tools

## Architecture Considerations

### Input Processing
- Parsing user queries for job criteria (role, skills, location, salary, etc.)
- Handling resume uploads (PDF, DOCX) and extracting text
- Parsing job descriptions from APIs or scraped web pages
- Understanding requests for resume tailoring, interview prep, or summarization

### Knowledge Representation
- User profile: skills, experience, job preferences, target roles/companies, resume text
- Structured job data retrieved from APIs/scraping (title, company, location, description, requirements, salary)
- Vector representations of resumes and job descriptions for matching
- Knowledge base of common interview questions (potentially generated by LLM based on role/company)

### Decision Logic
- Formulating search queries for job boards/APIs/web search
- Filtering and ranking job results based on user criteria and relevance
- Resume-to-job description matching algorithm (e.g., keyword overlap, embedding similarity, LLM assessment)
- Logic for identifying skill gaps based on target roles
- Prompting LLM to generate tailored resume/cover letter content based on user profile and job description
- Prompting LLM to generate relevant interview questions
- Summarization logic for job descriptions

### Tool Integration
- Job board API clients or web scraping tools
- Document loaders for resumes
- Text processing/embedding tools for matching
- LLM for NLU, generation, matching assessment, summarization
- Database ORM for user profile and saved jobs

### Output Formatting
- Clear list of job postings with key details and links
- Side-by-side comparison of resume and job description with match score/highlights
- Suggestions for resume/cover letter improvements
- Lists of relevant skills or interview questions
- Concise job description summaries

### Memory Management
- Storing user profile, skills, and resume information
- Caching job search results or scraped data
- Saving specific jobs the user is interested in
- Secure handling of personal data (resume, preferences)

### Error Handling
- Handling errors from job board APIs or web scraping
- Managing failures in resume parsing or text extraction
- Dealing with ambiguous job titles or criteria
- Providing feedback if no matching jobs are found
- Handling privacy and security concerns related to user data

## Implementation Flow
1. User provides job search criteria, uploads resume, or requests assistance (tailoring, interview prep).
2. Agent parses the request and retrieves user profile/resume if needed.
3. For job search: Agent uses tools (APIs, scrapers, search) to find job postings matching criteria.
4. For matching: Agent processes resume and job description, calculates match score/identifies gaps using embeddings or LLM.
5. For tailoring: Agent uses LLM with resume and job description to generate specific content suggestions.
6. For interview prep: Agent uses LLM (potentially with web search for company info) to generate likely questions.
7. For summarization: Agent processes job description and uses LLM to summarize.
8. Agent filters, ranks, and formats the results.
9. Agent presents the findings (job list, match analysis, content suggestions, questions, summary) to the user.

## Scaling Considerations
- Searching across a large number of job boards and company sites efficiently
- Performing complex resume-job matching at scale
- Keeping job posting information up-to-date
- Handling a large user base with diverse profiles and preferences

## Limitations
- Dependent on the availability and quality of job board APIs or scrapability of websites.
- Web scraping can be unreliable and ethically complex.
- Resume/job matching is not an exact science; results are indicative.
- Generated resume/cover letter content requires human review and refinement.
- Interview question suggestions are predictive and may not cover all actual questions.
- Cannot guarantee finding all relevant jobs or securing an interview/job.

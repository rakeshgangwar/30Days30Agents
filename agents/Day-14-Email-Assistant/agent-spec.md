# Day 14: Email Assistant Agent

## Agent Purpose
Helps users manage their email inbox by summarizing emails, drafting replies, prioritizing messages, and potentially automating email-related tasks.

## Key Features
- Email summarization (single emails or threads)
- Drafting replies based on context and user instructions
- Prioritization or categorization of emails (e.g., important, requires action)
- Extraction of key information or action items from emails
- Searching emails based on natural language queries
- Template generation for common replies

## Example Queries/Tasks
- "Summarize the latest email from John Doe."
- "Draft a polite decline to this meeting invitation."
- "What are the action items from the project update thread?"
- "Find the email with the attachment about the Q3 budget."
- "Prioritize my unread emails from today."
- "Create a template for acknowledging receipt of an application."

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: LangChain
- **Model**: GPT-4 or Claude-2
- **Tools**: Email APIs (Gmail API, Microsoft Graph API for Outlook/Office 365), Text processing libraries
- **Storage**: Database (optional, for storing templates, user preferences)
- **UI**: Streamlit, Web application, or potentially an email client plugin (more complex)

## Possible Integrations
- Calendar API (for scheduling meetings mentioned in emails)
- Task management tools (Todoist, Asana APIs for creating tasks from emails)
- CRM systems (for linking emails to contacts/deals)

## Architecture Considerations

### Input Processing
- Fetching emails using APIs (handling authentication securely)
- Parsing email content (headers, body, attachments)
- Understanding user commands for summarization, drafting, searching, etc.
- Identifying relevant context (previous emails in a thread)

### Knowledge Representation
- Structured representation of emails (sender, recipient, subject, body, date, thread ID)
- User preferences for summarization length, reply tone, prioritization rules
- Stored templates for common replies

### Decision Logic
- Summarization logic (extractive or abstractive)
- Reply generation based on email context and user prompt
- Prioritization algorithm (based on sender, keywords, user rules)
- Information extraction logic (identifying dates, names, action items)
- Search query formulation for email APIs

### Tool Integration
- Robust wrappers for email APIs (Gmail, Microsoft Graph) handling authentication (OAuth), fetching, sending, searching
- LLM for summarization, drafting, information extraction
- Database for storing templates or user rules

### Output Formatting
- Concise summaries
- Well-formatted draft replies
- Prioritized lists of emails
- Extracted information presented clearly
- Search results with relevant email snippets

### Memory Management
- Secure storage of API credentials/tokens (OAuth)
- Caching fetched emails or summaries for short periods
- Storing user preferences and templates
- Managing context window for long email threads

### Error Handling
- Handling email API errors (authentication failures, rate limits, connection issues)
- Managing failures in parsing email content
- Dealing with ambiguous user commands
- Providing feedback if an action (like sending an email) fails
- Ensuring privacy and security when accessing email content

## Implementation Flow
1. Agent authenticates with the user's email service (e.g., via OAuth).
2. User issues a command (summarize, draft, search, prioritize).
3. Agent uses email APIs to fetch relevant emails or perform searches.
4. Agent processes the email content.
5. Agent uses LLM for summarization, drafting, or information extraction as needed.
6. Agent applies prioritization logic if requested.
7. Agent formats the output (summary, draft, list, extracted info).
8. Agent presents the output to the user.
9. (Optional) Agent uses email APIs to send drafted replies or modify email status (e.g., mark as read) upon user confirmation.

## Scaling Considerations
- Handling very large mailboxes and high email volumes efficiently
- Implementing real-time email monitoring and notifications
- Supporting multiple email accounts per user
- Developing sophisticated prioritization and filtering rules

## Limitations
- Requires secure handling of email credentials and content (privacy concern).
- Summarization or drafting might miss context or make errors.
- Understanding the intent and nuances of all emails can be challenging.
- Actions taken (like sending emails) are irreversible and require user confirmation.
- Dependent on the reliability and features of the email provider's API.

## Testing Principles

Our testing approach is guided by the following principles:

1. **Early and Continuous Testing**: Testing begins in the development phase and continues throughout the development lifecycle.

2. **Shift-Left Testing**: Testing activities are moved earlier in the development cycle to identify issues sooner.

3. **Automated Testing**: Automate as much as possible to enable fast feedback loops and continuous testing.

4. **Deterministic Testing**: Tests should be reliable and produce consistent results.

5. **Isolation**: Tests should be isolated and not depend on the presence or state of other tests.

6. **Clear Purpose**: Each test should have a clear purpose and test a specific functionality.

7. **Test Coverage Balanced with Practicality**: Aim for comprehensive test coverage while balancing the cost of writing and maintaining tests.

8. **Adaptivity for AI Components**: Special techniques for testing non-deterministic AI components.

## Testing Pyramid

Our testing strategy follows the testing pyramid approach, with more emphasis on lower-level tests due to their speed and reliability, while still maintaining sufficient higher-level tests to ensure integration quality.

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests verify individual components in isolation. For the Learning Coach agent, unit tests will cover:

- **Backend Components**:
  - Python service classes and functions
  - API route handlers
  - Database models and queries
  - AI component functions (with appropriate mocking)
  - Utility functions

- **Frontend Components**:
  - React components
  - Custom hooks
  - State management functions
  - Utility functions
  - API service functions

### Component Integration Tests

Component integration tests verify interactions between related components:

- **Backend Integration**:
  - Service to service interaction
  - Database interaction
  - External API interaction (with mocks)
  - AI component integration with other services

- **Frontend Integration**:
  - Component composition
  - Context provider integration
  - Navigation flows

### API Integration Tests

API integration tests verify the API endpoints function correctly:

- HTTP status codes
- Response body structure
- Error handling
- Authentication and authorization
- API contract validation

### Workflow Integration Tests

Workflow integration tests verify end-to-end business processes:

- Learning path creation workflow
- Quiz session workflow
- Progress tracking workflow
- Multi-actor conversation workflows

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests verify the system works correctly from user perspective:

- User registration and login
- Learning path creation and navigation
- Content consumption
- Quiz taking
- Progress tracking and visualization

### Exploratory Testing

Manual testing to discover edge cases and issues that automated tests might miss:

- Usability issues
- Visual consistency
- Complex interaction patterns
- Edge case scenarios

## AI and LLM Testing

Testing AI components requires specialized approaches due to their non-deterministic nature.

    F --> F1[Bias Detection]
    F --> F2[Content Safety]
    F --> F3[Ethical Guidelines]
```

### LLM Testing Strategies

1. **Input/Output Contract Testing**:
   - Ensure outputs maintain expected structure regardless of exact content
   - Validate presence of required fields and adherence to schemas
   - Test handling of edge cases (empty inputs, very long inputs, etc.)

2. **Golden Dataset Testing**:
   - Create a dataset of exemplar inputs and expected outputs
   - Run regular regression tests against this dataset
   - Measure semantic similarity rather than exact matching

3. **Prompt Template Testing**:
   - Test variations of prompts for robustness
   - Ensure prompt changes don't break downstream processing
   - Version control prompt templates

4. **Semantic Evaluation**:
   - Test semantic correctness rather than exact text matching
   - Use embedding similarity metrics
   - Implement automatic evaluation using evaluation LLMs

5. **Adversarial Testing**:
   - Attempt to cause harmful, inappropriate, or incorrect outputs
   - Test prompt injection attacks
   - Test with malformed or unexpected inputs

6. **Simulation Testing**:
   - Create simulated user interactions
   - Test multi-turn conversations
   - Validate conversation flow and context retention

## LangGraph Workflow Testing

LangGraph workflows require specialized testing strategies due to their stateful nature and complex interactions.

        "conversation": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "Explain neural networks"}
        ],
        "variables": {
            "subject": "neural networks",
            "knowledge_level": "beginner"
        },
        "current_step": "explanation"
    }
    
    # Execute node
    result = tutor_node(test_state)
    
    # Assert on result structure
    assert "conversation" in result
    assert len(result["conversation"]) > len(test_state["conversation"])
    assert result["conversation"][-1]["role"] == "assistant"
    assert "neural networks" in result["conversation"][-1]["content"].lower()
    
    # Assert on expected state changes
    assert result["current_step"] == "awaiting_feedback"
    
# Example: Testing workflow state transitions
def test_orchestrator_routing():
    # Prepare test states
    explanation_request = {
        "conversation": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "Explain neural networks"}
        ],
        "variables": {},
        "current_step": "initial"
    }
    
    quiz_request = {
        "conversation": [
            {"role": "user", "content": "Quiz me on neural networks"}
        ],
        "variables": {},
        "current_step": "initial"
    }
    
    # Get routing decisions
    explanation_route = should_route_to_tutor(explanation_request)
    quiz_route = should_route_to_tutor(quiz_request)
    
    # Assert correct routing
    assert explanation_route is True  # Should route to tutor
    assert quiz_route is False  # Should route to quiz generator
```

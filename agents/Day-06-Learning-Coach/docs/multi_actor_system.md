## Testing Strategy

The multi-actor system requires specialized testing approaches:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test each agent in isolation with fixed inputs
2. **Agent Interaction Tests**: Test pairs of agents working together
3. **Orchestration Tests**: Test the orchestrator's ability to select the right agent
4. **End-to-End Conversation Tests**: Test complete learning sessions
5. **Failure Mode Tests**: Test recovery from failed handoffs or misunderstandings
6. **Performance Tests**: Test response time and resource utilization with multiple agents

## Development Phasing

The implementation will follow this sequence:

1. Implement base agent infrastructure and orchestrator
2. Develop tutor agent (core teaching functionality)
3. Add critic agent (assessment and feedback)
4. Integrate coach agent (motivation and strategy)
5. Add researcher agent (resource discovery)
6. Refine inter-agent communication
7. Optimize performance and handoffs

## Conclusion

The multi-actor system leverages LangGraph's capabilities to create a more specialized, effective learning experience. By distributing responsibilities across specialized agents, the system can provide higher quality assistance in each domain while maintaining a coherent overall experience through careful orchestration and state management.

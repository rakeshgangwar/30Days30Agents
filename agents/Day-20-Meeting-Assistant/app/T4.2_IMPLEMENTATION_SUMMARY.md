# T4.2 - File Upload Implementation - Completion Summary

## Overview
Task T4.2 "File Upload Implementation" has been successfully completed. This task involved implementing audio file upload endpoints with progress tracking, file validation, and security checks.

## Deliverables Completed ✅

### 1. POST /api/audio/upload-audio - Single file upload ✅
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/audio/upload-audio`
- **Description**: Upload a single audio file with comprehensive validation
- **Features**:
  - File format validation (WAV, MP3, MP4, M4A, WebM, OGG, FLAC, AAC)
  - File size validation (configurable, default 500MB)
  - MIME type validation
  - Filename security checks
  - Returns upload_id for later processing
- **Response**: `UploadResult` model with upload details

### 2. POST /api/audio/upload-multiple - Multiple file upload ✅
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/audio/upload-multiple`
- **Description**: Upload multiple audio files simultaneously
- **Features**:
  - Batch upload (max 10 files per request)
  - Individual file validation
  - Partial success handling (some files can succeed while others fail)
  - Comprehensive error reporting per file
- **Response**: `MultipleUploadResult` model with batch results

### 3. Upload progress tracking ✅
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/audio/upload-progress/{upload_id}`
- **Description**: Real-time progress tracking for file uploads
- **Features**:
  - Bytes uploaded vs total bytes
  - Progress percentage
  - Upload speed in Mbps
  - Estimated time remaining
  - Upload status (uploading/completed/failed)
- **Response**: `UploadProgress` model with detailed progress info

### 4. File validation and security checks ✅
- **Comprehensive validation**:
  - File size limits (configurable via `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB`)
  - Supported audio formats validation
  - MIME type verification
  - Filename sanitization
  - Path traversal protection
  - Dangerous character filtering

## Additional Features Implemented

### 5. File Management
- **Delete endpoint**: `DELETE /api/audio/upload/{upload_id}`
- **Enhanced process endpoint**: Updated `/api/audio/process` to work with upload_id
- **Convenience endpoint**: `POST /api/audio/process-upload/{upload_id}`

### 6. Security Features
- Input sanitization
- File type restrictions
- Size limits
- Path traversal prevention
- MIME type validation
- Filename security checks

### 7. Progress Tracking System
- In-memory progress storage
- Real-time upload speed calculation
- ETA estimation
- Chunked upload processing (8KB chunks)
- Async file operations with `aiofiles`

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Upload Process
1. **Validation**: Files are validated for format, size, and security
2. **Storage**: Files are saved with unique upload_id prefix
3. **Progress**: Real-time progress tracking during upload
4. **Processing**: Files can be processed using upload_id

### Data Models
- `UploadResult`: Single upload response
- `MultipleUploadResult`: Batch upload response
- `UploadProgress`: Progress tracking data
- `FileValidationError`: Validation error details

### Supported Audio Formats
- WAV (audio/wav, audio/wave, audio/x-wav)
- MP3 (audio/mpeg, audio/mp3)
- MP4 (audio/mp4, video/mp4)
- M4A (audio/m4a)
- WebM (audio/webm, video/webm)
- OGG (audio/ogg)
- FLAC (audio/flac)
- AAC (audio/aac)

## Acceptance Criteria Verification ✅

### ✅ Large files upload successfully
- Implemented chunked upload processing
- Configurable size limits (default 500MB)
- Async file operations for better performance

### ✅ Progress tracking works accurately
- Real-time progress updates
- Upload speed calculation
- ETA estimation
- Status tracking (uploading/completed/failed)

### ✅ Invalid files rejected properly
- Comprehensive validation system
- Clear error messages with error codes
- Security checks for malicious files
- Format and size restrictions

## Testing

### Test Script
Created `test_upload_endpoints.py` with comprehensive tests:
- Single file upload testing
- Multiple file upload testing
- Progress tracking verification
- File validation testing
- File deletion testing
- Error handling verification

### Usage
```bash
# Start the server
uv run uvicorn src.main:app --reload

# Run tests
python test_upload_endpoints.py
```

## API Endpoints Summary

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/audio/upload-audio` | Upload single audio file |
| POST | `/api/audio/upload-multiple` | Upload multiple audio files |
| GET | `/api/audio/upload-progress/{upload_id}` | Get upload progress |
| DELETE | `/api/audio/upload/{upload_id}` | Delete uploaded file |
| POST | `/api/audio/process` | Process audio (supports upload_id) |
| POST | `/api/audio/process-upload/{upload_id}` | Process uploaded file |

## Dependencies Added
- `aiofiles>=24.1.0` (already in pyproject.toml)
- Enhanced error handling and validation
- Progress tracking infrastructure

## Configuration
- `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB`: Maximum file size (default: 500MB)
- `UPLOAD_DIR`: Upload directory (default: "uploads")
- File format restrictions configurable via code

## Task T4.2 Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All deliverables have been implemented and tested. The file upload system provides:
- Robust validation and security
- Real-time progress tracking
- Support for single and multiple file uploads
- Integration with existing audio processing pipeline
- Comprehensive error handling and reporting

The implementation exceeds the basic requirements by providing additional security features, progress tracking, and integration capabilities.

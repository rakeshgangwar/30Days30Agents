# Day 20: Meeting Assistant Agent

## Agent Purpose
Assists with meeting-related tasks by processing meeting transcripts (or potentially audio) to generate summaries, identify key decisions, and extract action items.

## Key Features
- Processing of meeting transcripts (text input)
- Optional: Audio transcription (from file using STT models/APIs)
- Optional: Speaker diarization (identifying who spoke when)
- Meeting summarization (key discussion points)
- Key decision identification
- Action item extraction (task, assignee, deadline if mentioned)
- Generation of structured meeting notes

## Example Queries/Tasks
- "Summarize this meeting transcript."
- "Based on this transcript, what were the main outcomes?"
- "Extract the action items from this meeting discussion."
- "Identify any decisions made in this meeting text."
- "Generate concise meeting notes from the provided transcript."
- (If audio input enabled) "Transcribe and summarize this meeting recording."

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: LangChain or CrewAI
- **Model**: LLM (GPT-4, Claude-2/3) for summarization/extraction. Optional: Speech-to-Text model/API (e.g., OpenAI Whisper, AssemblyAI)
- **Tools**: Text processing libraries. Optional: Audio processing libraries (pydub), Diarization models/libraries (pyannote.audio)
- **Storage**: Database (optional, for storing processed results)
- **UI**: Streamlit or Web application (allowing text paste or file uploads)

## Possible Integrations
- Calendar APIs (for fetching meeting context like attendees/topic)
- Task management tools (Todoist, Asana APIs for creating tasks from action items)
- Video conferencing platforms (Zoom, Google Meet APIs for fetching transcripts - complex)

## Architecture Considerations

### Input Processing
- Accepting text transcript input (pasted or from file)
- Optional: Handling audio file uploads and processing via STT tools
- Optional: Applying speaker diarization to audio/transcript
- Parsing user requests for specific analysis (summary, decisions, actions)

### Knowledge Representation
- Structured representation of the input transcript (potentially with speaker labels/timestamps if available)
- Templates for generating structured meeting notes
- Defined patterns or keywords for identifying decisions and action items (can supplement LLM)

### Decision Logic
- Chunking strategies for long transcripts to fit LLM context windows
- Summarization prompting strategies (e.g., map-reduce, refine) optimized for dialogue
- Prompting techniques specifically designed to extract decisions (looking for consensus, proposals, agreements)
- Prompting techniques for extracting action items (identifying verbs, assignees, objects, deadlines)
- Logic to synthesize extracted information into coherent meeting notes

### Tool Integration
- LLM for core analysis (summarization, extraction)
- Optional: STT service/library
- Optional: Diarization library/service
- Text processing tools for cleaning/structuring transcript data

### Output Formatting
- Concise and informative summaries covering key topics
- Clearly listed key decisions
- Structured action items (e.g., TASK: [description], ASSIGNEE: [name], DUE: [date/time])
- Well-formatted meeting notes document (e.g., in Markdown)

### Memory Management
- Handling potentially long transcripts within processing limits
- Storing intermediate results (e.g., chunk summaries in map-reduce)
- No long-term memory typically needed unless tracking across multiple meetings for a project

### Error Handling
- Handling errors if optional STT/diarization tools fail
- Managing LLM context window limitations for very long transcripts
- Providing feedback if the transcript quality is poor or lacks expected structure
- Gracefully handling cases where no decisions or action items are identified
- Ensuring clarity if extraction results are ambiguous

## Implementation Flow
1. User provides meeting transcript text (or audio file if enabled).
2. (If audio) Agent uses STT and potentially diarization tools to generate a structured transcript.
3. Agent preprocesses the transcript (cleaning, chunking if necessary).
4. User requests specific analysis (summary, actions, decisions) or agent performs a default set.
5. Agent constructs prompts for the LLM based on the transcript chunks and the requested analysis.
6. Agent calls the LLM to generate summaries, extract decisions, and identify action items.
7. Agent synthesizes the results from the LLM (and potentially across chunks).
8. Agent formats the output into the desired format (summary text, lists, meeting notes).
9. Agent presents the results to the user.

## Scaling Considerations
- Efficiently processing very long meeting transcripts
- Improving the accuracy of extraction, especially for nuanced decisions or implicitly assigned actions
- Integrating with real-time meeting platforms
- Customizing extraction for specific meeting types or organizational jargon

## Limitations
- Accuracy is highly dependent on the quality and clarity of the input transcript.
- LLM might misinterpret conversational nuances, sarcasm, or implicit agreements.
- Identifying correct assignees or deadlines for action items relies on them being explicitly stated.
- Summarization might miss subtle but important points.
- Cannot capture non-verbal communication or visual information from a meeting.

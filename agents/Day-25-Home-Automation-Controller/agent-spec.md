# Day 25: Home Automation Controller Agent

## Agent Purpose
Controls smart home devices (lights, thermostats, locks, etc.) using natural language commands by interacting with relevant APIs or platforms like Home Assistant, Google Home, or Alexa.

## Key Features
- Control smart devices (turn on/off, set brightness/color/temperature)
- Query device status (is the light on? what's the temperature?)
- Execute scenes or routines (e.g., "Movie Time", "Good Morning")
- Group control (e.g., "Turn off all lights downstairs")
- Potentially triggered by voice commands (integrating Day 21)

## Example Queries/Tasks
- "Turn on the living room lights."
- "Set the thermostat to 22 degrees Celsius."
- "Dim the bedroom lights to 30%."
- "Is the front door locked?"
- "Activate the 'Good Night' scene."
- "Turn off all the lights."
- (Voice) "Hey Assistant, make the kitchen lights blue."

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: LangChain or a custom Python application
- **Model**: LLM (GPT, Claude, etc.) for NLU
- **Tools**: Smart Home Platform APIs/Libraries (Home Assistant Python client, Philips Hue API wrapper, Google Home/Alexa SDKs - might be complex/limited), MQTT clients (if applicable)
- **Storage**: Configuration file or database for device mapping and API keys/tokens
- **UI**: Command-line, Web UI (Streamlit), or Voice Interface (using Day 21 components)

## Possible Integrations
- Voice Assistant (Day 21) for voice control
- Calendar API (trigger routines based on events)
- Weather API (adjust thermostat based on forecast)
- Security system APIs

## Architecture Considerations

### Input Processing
- Parsing natural language commands (text or transcribed voice)
- Identifying the target device(s) or scene
- Extracting the desired action (on, off, set value) and parameters (brightness, color, temperature)
- Mapping user-friendly names ("living room lamp") to device IDs used by the API

### Knowledge Representation
- A registry or map of known devices, their types, capabilities, and API identifiers
- Definitions of scenes or routines and the actions they entail
- Current state of devices (optional, could be fetched on demand)
- API credentials and connection details

### Decision Logic
- Translating the parsed command into specific API calls for the target device(s)
- Handling ambiguous commands (e.g., "turn on the light" - which one?) through clarification or default behavior
- Logic for executing multi-step scenes or routines
- Determining which API or protocol (REST, MQTT, specific library) to use for a given device

### Tool Integration
- Wrappers or clients for specific smart home APIs (Home Assistant, Hue, etc.)
- LLM for understanding the natural language command
- Configuration management for API keys and device mappings

### Output Formatting
- Confirmation messages to the user (e.g., "Okay, turned on the living room lights.")
- Responses to status queries (e.g., "The thermostat is set to 21 degrees.")
- Error messages if a command fails or a device is unreachable

### Memory Management
- Storing device mappings and API configurations
- Caching device states (optional, needs careful handling of staleness)
- Secure storage of sensitive API keys and tokens

### Error Handling
- Handling errors from smart home APIs (authentication failure, device unavailable, invalid command)
- Managing network connectivity issues
- Providing clear feedback to the user when a command cannot be executed
- Dealing with unrecognized devices or commands
- Ensuring security and preventing unauthorized access/control

## Implementation Flow
1. User issues a command (text or voice).
2. (If voice) STT transcribes the command.
3. Agent uses LLM to parse the command, identifying intent, device(s), action, and parameters.
4. Agent looks up the device ID(s) and required API details from its configuration/registry.
5. Agent formulates the appropriate API call(s) based on the parsed command.
6. Agent executes the API call(s) using the relevant tool/wrapper.
7. Agent receives the response from the API (success/failure, status data).
8. Agent generates a confirmation or status response message for the user.
9. (If voice) TTS synthesizes the response message for playback.
10. Agent presents the response to the user (text or speech).

## Scaling Considerations
- Supporting a large number and variety of smart home devices and platforms
- Handling complex routines involving multiple devices and conditions
- Ensuring low latency for responsive control
- Managing API rate limits across different services

## Limitations
- Highly dependent on the specific smart home APIs available and their capabilities/limitations.
- Requires setup and configuration to map devices and authenticate with APIs.
- Network latency or device unreachability can cause delays or failures.
- NLU might misinterpret commands, especially complex or ambiguous ones.
- Security is paramount; requires careful handling of credentials and potentially network isolation.
- Real-time state synchronization across multiple control interfaces can be complex.

# Day 22: E-commerce Assistant Agent

## Agent Purpose
Assists users with online shopping by providing product recommendations, comparing products, searching across e-commerce platforms (or a specific one), and potentially tracking prices or availability.

## Key Features
- Product search based on natural language descriptions
- Personalized product recommendations (based on user preferences or past behavior)
- Product comparison (features, price, reviews)
- Filtering and sorting search results
- Summarizing product reviews
- Price tracking or availability alerts (optional, requires persistent monitoring)

## Example Queries/Tasks
- "Find me a red running shoe under $100 with good cushioning."
- "Recommend a good laptop for programming."
- "Compare the latest iPhone with the latest Samsung Galaxy phone."
- "Show me 4-star rated bluetooth headphones sorted by price."
- "Summarize the positive and negative reviews for this product: [link]."
- "Alert me when the price of this item drops below $50."

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: LangChain or CrewAI
- **Model**: GPT-4 or Claude-2/3
- **Tools**: E-commerce APIs (Amazon Product Advertising API, eBay API, specific store APIs if available), Web scraping tools (BeautifulSoup, Scrapy - use ethically and responsibly), Price tracking APIs (if available), Web search
- **Storage**: Database (for user preferences, tracked products, potentially scraped data)
- **UI**: Streamlit, Web application

## Possible Integrations
- Affiliate marketing platforms
- User accounts for personalized history/preferences
- Shopping cart APIs (for adding items directly - complex)
- Review aggregation platforms

## Architecture Considerations

### Input Processing
- Parsing user queries for product descriptions, features, constraints (price, rating), and actions (search, compare, recommend, summarize)
- Extracting product identifiers (links, names, SKUs)
- Handling ambiguous queries or requests for clarification

### Knowledge Representation
- Structured product data retrieved from APIs or scraping (title, price, features, description, reviews, URL)
- User profile with preferences (brands, categories, price range) and potentially purchase history
- Vector representations of product descriptions/features for similarity search (optional)
- Stored data for price tracking (product ID, target price, last checked price/time)

### Decision Logic
- Query formulation for e-commerce APIs or web search
- Filtering and ranking logic based on user criteria (price, rating, features)
- Product comparison logic (identifying comparable features, presenting differences)
- Recommendation logic (content-based, collaborative filtering if user data exists, or LLM-based reasoning)
- Review summarization prompting (identifying pros/cons, common themes)
- Price tracking logic (checking prices periodically, triggering alerts)

### Tool Integration
- API clients for e-commerce platforms
- Web scraping tools (carefully managed to respect `robots.txt` and terms of service)
- LLM for NLU, recommendation reasoning, and review summarization
- Database ORM for storing user preferences and tracked products
- Optional: Alerting mechanism (email, notification service)

### Output Formatting
- Clear presentation of product lists with key details (image, title, price, rating)
- Structured comparison tables
- Concise review summaries (pros/cons)
- Personalized recommendations with justifications
- Price alerts

### Memory Management
- Storing user preferences and potentially interaction history
- Managing scraped product data (caching, updating)
- Maintaining the list of products being tracked for price changes
- Secure handling of API keys

### Error Handling
- Handling errors from e-commerce APIs (invalid queries, rate limits, authentication)
- Managing web scraping failures (site structure changes, blocks)
- Dealing with unavailable products or missing information (price, reviews)
- Providing feedback when search results are empty or criteria are too restrictive
- Handling errors in price tracking or alert delivery

## Implementation Flow
1. User provides a shopping-related query (search, compare, recommend, track).
2. Agent parses the query to understand intent and criteria.
3. Agent selects appropriate tools (API client, web scraper, web search).
4. Agent queries APIs or scrapes websites to gather product information (search results, product details, reviews).
5. Agent processes and structures the retrieved data.
6. Agent applies filtering, sorting, comparison, or summarization logic as needed, potentially using LLM.
7. For recommendations, agent uses user preferences and product data (with LLM or other algorithms).
8. For price tracking, agent stores the product and target price, scheduling periodic checks.
9. Agent formats the results (product list, comparison, summary, confirmation of tracking).
10. Agent presents the results to the user.

## Scaling Considerations
- Handling a large number of product searches and comparisons efficiently
- Managing API costs and rate limits across multiple platforms
- Building a robust and adaptable web scraping infrastructure (if used)
- Developing sophisticated personalization and recommendation models
- Implementing near real-time price tracking

## Limitations
- Dependent on the availability and reliability of e-commerce APIs or website structures.
- Web scraping can be fragile and may violate terms of service.
- Product information (prices, availability) can change rapidly.
- Review summarization might miss nuances or be biased.
- Recommendations might be generic without deep personalization data.
- Cannot guarantee finding the absolute best price or deal across all possible retailers.

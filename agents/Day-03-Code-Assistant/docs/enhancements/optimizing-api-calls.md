# Optimizing API Calls for Large Codebase Analysis

## Current Challenges

Our Code Assistant currently faces several challenges when analyzing large codebases:

1. **High API Token Usage**: Analyzing entire files consumes a significant number of API tokens, especially with large repositories.
2. **Context Window Limitations**: LLMs have context window limits (e.g., 128K tokens for most models), restricting how much code can be analyzed at once.
3. **Redundant Analysis**: The current implementation may re-analyze unchanged files, wasting API calls.
4. **Limited Prioritization**: All files are treated equally, without prioritizing more important or complex files.
5. **Inefficient Context Management**: The entire file content is included in the context, rather than just the essential structures.

## Optimization Strategies

Based on our analysis of other code assistants like Cline and Augment, we've identified several strategies to optimize API calls:

### 1. Selective Code Analysis

- **AST-based Analysis**: Use Tree-sitter to parse code into Abstract Syntax Trees and extract only essential definitions and structures.
- **File Filtering**: Limit analysis to a reasonable number of files (e.g., 50) with supported extensions.
- **Language Prioritization**: Prioritize certain languages based on their importance to the project.

### 2. Vector Database for Semantic Search

- **Embedding-Based Retrieval**: Convert code snippets and files into vector embeddings that capture their semantic meaning.
- **Similarity Search**: Find the most semantically relevant code for each query.
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Retrieve only the most relevant code snippets for analysis.

### 3. Context Management System

- **Two-Tier Context System**:
  - **Workspace Context**: Maintain a comprehensive understanding of the entire codebase structure.
  - **Query Context**: Select only the most relevant portions for each specific query.
- **Dynamic Context Window Management**: Adjust context window limits based on the specific model being used.
- **Proactive Truncation**: Maintain buffer space to prevent context window errors.

### 4. Caching Mechanisms

- **API Response Caching**: Cache API responses to avoid redundant API calls.
- **File Context Tracking**: Track file operations to avoid reloading unchanged files.
- **Incremental Indexing**: Only re-index files that have changed since the last analysis.

### 5. Relationship Mapping

- **Dependency Graph**: Build a graph of relationships between different parts of the codebase.
- **Import Analysis**: Track imports and function calls to understand code relationships.
- **Context Expansion**: Include related code that might be relevant to the current query.

## Implementation Plan

We recommend a phased approach to implementing these optimizations:

### Phase 1: Basic Selective Analysis (1-2 weeks)

1. **Implement Tree-sitter Integration**:
   - Use Tree-sitter to parse code and extract essential structures.
   - Focus on definitions, interfaces, and important patterns.

2. **Add File Filtering**:
   - Limit analysis to a configurable number of files.
   - Prioritize files based on language and complexity.
   - Exclude non-essential files (e.g., node_modules, build artifacts).

### Phase 2: Caching and Context Management (2-3 weeks)

1. **Implement Basic Caching**:
   - Cache analysis results to avoid re-analyzing unchanged files.
   - Track file modifications to invalidate cache entries.

2. **Enhance Context Management**:
   - Implement dynamic context window management.
   - Add proactive truncation to prevent context window errors.
   - Develop strategies for prioritizing context.

### Phase 3: Vector Search and Semantic Analysis (3-4 weeks)

1. **Implement Vector Database**:
   - Use a library like `hnswlib` or `faiss` for vector storage.
   - Create embeddings for code snippets using a model like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small.

2. **Add Semantic Search**:
   - Implement similarity search to find relevant code.
   - Develop ranking algorithms to prioritize results.

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (4+ weeks)

1. **Relationship Mapping**:
   - Build a graph of code relationships.
   - Use the graph to include related code in the context.

2. **Context Compression**:
   - Develop techniques to represent code more efficiently.
   - Extract key symbols and filter out less relevant content.

3. **Multi-Repository Support**:
   - Add support for analyzing multiple related repositories.
   - Maintain relationships between different codebases.

## Expected Benefits

Implementing these optimizations will provide several benefits:

1. **Reduced API Costs**: By sending only essential code to the AI model, we can significantly reduce API token usage.
2. **Improved Performance**: More efficient analysis will result in faster response times.
3. **Better Analysis Quality**: By focusing on the most relevant code, the AI can provide more accurate and helpful analysis.
4. **Support for Larger Codebases**: The system will be able to handle much larger repositories without running into context limitations.
5. **More Efficient Context Usage**: Making better use of the available context window will allow for more comprehensive analysis.

## Metrics for Success

We'll measure the success of these optimizations using the following metrics:

1. **API Token Usage**: Reduction in tokens used per analysis (target: 50% reduction).
2. **Analysis Time**: Reduction in time required to analyze a repository (target: 30% reduction).
3. **Context Efficiency**: Increase in the amount of useful code that can be included in the context (target: 100% increase).
4. **Repository Size Support**: Maximum repository size that can be effectively analyzed (target: 10x increase).
5. **User Satisfaction**: Improvement in the quality and relevance of analysis results (measured through user feedback).

## Conclusion

By implementing these optimizations, we can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our Code Assistant when analyzing large codebases. This will result in reduced costs, improved performance, and better analysis quality, ultimately providing a better experience for our users.

# Day 8: Finance Tracker Agent

## Agent Purpose
Helps users track personal expenses, monitor budgets, categorize transactions, and gain insights into their spending habits. Provides basic financial advice based on tracked data.

## Key Features
- Manual transaction logging via natural language
- Automatic transaction categorization (based on rules or LLM)
- Budget creation and tracking per category
- Spending analysis and visualization
- Alerts for budget overspending
- Basic financial insights and tips

## Example Queries
- "Log a $5 coffee expense at Starbucks."
- "How much have I spent on groceries this month?"
- "Set a monthly budget of $500 for dining out."
- "Show me a pie chart of my spending by category for last month."
- "Am I over budget on entertainment?"
- "Give me tips on how to save more money based on my spending."

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: LangChain
- **Model**: GPT-3.5-Turbo or GPT-4
- **Tools**: Data analysis libraries (Pandas), Visualization libraries (Matplotlib/Plotly)
- **Storage**: Database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) for transactions, budgets, categories
- **UI**: Streamlit or a dedicated web application (Flask/React)

## Possible Integrations
- Plaid API for automatic bank transaction import (requires handling sensitive data securely)
- Receipt scanning tools (OCR)
- Budgeting apps (YNAB, Mint APIs if available)
- Investment tracking platforms

## Architecture Considerations

### Input Processing
- Parsing natural language commands for logging expenses (amount, vendor, category, date)
- Understanding queries about spending, budgets, and categories
- Handling inputs for setting or modifying budgets

### Knowledge Representation
- Structured database schema for users, accounts, transactions, categories, and budgets
- Rules engine or LLM-based logic for transaction categorization
- Stored financial summaries or pre-calculated metrics

### Decision Logic
- Transaction categorization logic (rule-based matching, LLM classification)
- Budget calculation and comparison against spending
- Logic for generating spending reports and insights
- Triggering alerts based on budget thresholds

### Tool Integration
- Database ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy) for data persistence
- Pandas for data aggregation and analysis
- Plotting libraries for generating charts
- LLM for natural language understanding and insight generation

### Output Formatting
- Clear display of transactions and balances
- Structured budget overview showing spending vs. limits
- Embedded charts (pie charts, bar charts) for spending analysis
- Actionable financial tips and alerts

### Memory Management
- Secure storage of all financial data in the database
- User session management
- Caching of frequently accessed reports or summaries

### Error Handling
- Validation of user inputs (e.g., ensuring amounts are numeric)
- Handling database errors
- Graceful management of failed categorizations (e.g., assigning to 'uncategorized')
- Secure handling of potential PII or financial data

## Implementation Flow
1. User interacts via UI or natural language command.
2. Agent parses input to identify intent (log expense, query data, set budget).
3. If logging expense, agent extracts details, categorizes, and saves to the database.
4. If querying data, agent retrieves data from the database, performs analysis (using Pandas), generates visualizations (using Matplotlib/Plotly), and/or uses LLM to generate insights.
5. If setting budget, agent updates budget information in the database.
6. Agent checks for budget alerts based on current spending.
7. Agent formats and presents the results (text, table, chart, alert) to the user.

## Scaling Considerations
- Handling a large volume of transactions efficiently
- Supporting multiple users securely
- Integrating with external financial data sources (requires robust security and error handling)
- Implementing more sophisticated financial analysis and forecasting

## Limitations
- Primarily relies on manual input unless integrated with external APIs like Plaid.
- Categorization might require manual correction.
- Financial advice provided will be generic and not personalized investment advice.
- Security is paramount when handling financial data; requires careful implementation.
- Does not handle complex financial instruments or investment tracking initially.

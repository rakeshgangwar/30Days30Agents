# Day 1: Personal Assistant Agent

## Agent Purpose
A foundation agent that handles basic personal assistance tasks such as setting reminders, answering questions, and providing information.

## Key Features
- Natural language query processing
- Information retrieval from open-source knowledge bases
- Basic memory to track user preferences
- Simple task management (reminders, notes)

## Example Queries
- "What's the weather like in New York today?"
- "Remind me to call my doctor tomorrow at 10 AM"
- "How many calories are in an apple?"
- "Who won the World Series last year?"

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: LangChain
- **Model**: GPT-3.5-Turbo
- **UI**: Streamlit

## Possible Integrations
- Weather API
- Wikipedia API
- News API

## Architecture Considerations

### Input Processing
- Simple natural language understanding without complex parsing
- Intent classification to categorize queries (information, task creation, reminder)
- Entity extraction for key information (dates, times, locations)

### Knowledge Representation
- External API calls for real-time data
- No persistent knowledge base in initial version
- Simple JSON configuration for user preferences

### Decision Logic
- Rule-based intent identification
- Query routing based on recognized intents
- Simple if-else logic for handling different query types

### Tool Integration
- Basic API connectors for weather, information lookup
- Simple time-based reminder system
- Text template for consistent responses

### Output Formatting
- Text responses with some basic formatting
- Structured data for weather and factual information
- Confirmation messages for tasks and reminders

### Memory Management
- Simple key-value store for short-term context
- User preferences stored in local JSON file
- No long-term conversational memory in initial version

### Error Handling
- Generic error messages with fallbacks to web search
- Graceful handling of API failures
- Clarification requests for ambiguous queries

## Implementation Flow
1. User inputs a query
2. Agent classifies the query intent
3. If information request, agent calls appropriate API
4. If task/reminder creation, agent extracts details and stores them
5. Agent formats response based on query type
6. Response is presented to user

## Scaling Considerations
- Add persistent database for user preferences and reminders
- Implement conversational memory for more natural interactions
- Add more specialized APIs for enhanced capabilities
- Implement user authentication for multi-user support

## Limitations
- Limited to predefined intents and capabilities
- No complex reasoning or planning abilities
- Cannot perform actions requiring API authentication
- No integration with calendar or other personal systems initially

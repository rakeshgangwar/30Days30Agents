# Day 17: Music Recommendation Agent

## Agent Purpose
Provides personalized music recommendations based on user preferences, listening history, mood, or specified genres/artists.

## Key Features
- Recommendations based on favorite artists, genres, or tracks
- Mood-based playlist generation
- Discovery of new or similar artists
- Integration with music streaming service data (e.g., Spotify)
- Explanations for recommendations

## Example Queries/Tasks
- "Recommend some artists similar to Tame Impala."
- "Create a playlist for a chill evening."
- "What are some popular indie rock bands I might like?"
- "Based on my listening history, suggest some new albums." (Requires integration)
- "Why did you recommend this song?"
- "Find upbeat electronic music."

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: LangChain
- **Model**: GPT-4 or Claude-2/3
- **Tools**: Music APIs (Spotify API, Last.fm API, MusicBrainz API), Web search (for artist info/genres)
- **Storage**: Database (for user preferences, listening history if tracked)
- **UI**: Streamlit, Web application, or command-line interface

## Possible Integrations
- Direct control of music playback via streaming service APIs
- Social features (sharing recommendations with friends)
- Concert recommendation APIs (e.g., Songkick)

## Architecture Considerations

### Input Processing
- Parsing user requests for recommendations (by artist, genre, mood, similarity)
- Extracting entities like artist names, genre names, mood descriptors
- Handling authentication and data retrieval from music service APIs (e.g., Spotify OAuth)

### Knowledge Representation
- User profile: favorite genres, artists, listening history (if available)
- LLM's knowledge of music genres, artists, and relationships
- Data retrieved from music APIs (track features, artist similarity, playlists)
- Vector representations of songs or artists based on features/genres (optional, for similarity)

### Decision Logic
- Recommendation algorithm:
    - Using music API features (e.g., Spotify's recommendation endpoint)
    - LLM-based reasoning based on genre, mood, artist similarity
    - Collaborative filtering or content-based filtering if sufficient user data is available
- Playlist generation logic based on mood or genre criteria
- Logic to explain the reasoning behind a recommendation

### Tool Integration
- Wrappers for music APIs (Spotify, Last.fm) to search tracks/artists, get recommendations, fetch user data, retrieve audio features
- LLM for understanding requests and generating explanations
- Web search for supplementary artist/genre information

### Output Formatting
- List of recommended tracks, artists, or albums with links (e.g., Spotify links)
- Generated playlists
- Explanations for recommendations presented clearly
- Information about artists or genres

### Memory Management
- Storing user preferences and potentially summarized listening history
- Caching API responses (e.g., artist details)
- Secure handling of API tokens (OAuth)

### Error Handling
- Handling errors from music APIs (invalid requests, rate limits, authentication issues)
- Managing cases where no recommendations are found
- Dealing with ambiguous artist names or genre descriptions
- Providing feedback if user data (listening history) is unavailable

## Implementation Flow
1. User provides input (favorite artist, genre, mood, request based on history).
2. Agent parses the request and identifies the recommendation criteria.
3. (If applicable) Agent uses music API tools to fetch user data (history, liked songs) or search for seed artists/tracks.
4. Agent uses music API recommendation endpoints or LLM reasoning (or both) to generate recommendations based on criteria.
5. Agent retrieves details (track names, artists, links) for the recommendations using music APIs.
6. Agent formats the recommendations (list, playlist) and potentially generates explanations using LLM.
7. Agent presents the recommendations and explanations to the user.

## Scaling Considerations
- Handling a large number of users and their listening data
- Optimizing API calls to stay within rate limits
- Building more sophisticated recommendation models (e.g., hybrid approaches)
- Keeping up with new music releases and changing trends

## Limitations
- Recommendation quality depends heavily on the underlying music API and LLM knowledge.
- Accessing detailed user listening history requires explicit user authorization (OAuth) and privacy considerations.
- Mood-based recommendations can be subjective.
- May struggle with very niche genres or artists not well-represented in APIs/LLM training data.
- Cannot guarantee the user will like the recommendations.

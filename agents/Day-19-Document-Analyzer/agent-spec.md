# Day 19: Document Analyzer Agent

## Agent Purpose
Processes and analyzes text documents (e.g., PDF, DOCX, TXT) to extract key information, answer questions about the content, summarize sections, and potentially compare multiple documents.

## Key Features
- Document loading from various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Text extraction and preprocessing
- Summarization of entire documents or specific sections
- Question-answering based on document content (RAG)
- Key information extraction (e.g., names, dates, key terms, entities)
- Comparison between multiple documents (identifying similarities/differences - optional)

## Example Queries/Tasks
- "Load this PDF report and summarize the introduction."
- "What methodology is described in this research paper (DOCX)?"
- "Extract all dates mentioned in this contract (PDF)."
- "Compare the 'Scope of Work' sections in these two proposals (DOCX)."
- "Find sentences related to 'data privacy' in this policy document (TXT)."
- "Answer questions about the content of the uploaded technical specification."

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: LangChain or LlamaIndex (strong focus on document processing and RAG)
- **Model**: GPT-4 or Claude-2/3
- **Tools**: Document loaders (PyPDF, python-docx, unstructured), Text splitters, Embedding models (e.g., OpenAIEmbeddings, HuggingFaceEmbeddings), Vector stores (Chroma, FAISS, Pinecone)
- **UI**: Streamlit or Gradio (allowing file uploads)

## Possible Integrations
- Cloud storage providers (Google Drive, Dropbox, S3) for document sources
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools (PyTesseract) for image-based PDFs
- Knowledge graph creation tools based on extracted entities and relationships
- Data visualization libraries for presenting analysis results

## Architecture Considerations

### Input Processing
- Handling file uploads (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
- Using appropriate document loaders to extract text and potentially metadata
- Text cleaning and preprocessing (handling formatting inconsistencies)
- Parsing user queries to determine the analysis task (summarize, QA, extract, compare)

### Knowledge Representation
- Text chunking strategies optimized for the document type and task
- Generating embeddings for text chunks
- Storing text chunks and embeddings in a vector store
- Storing extracted entities or structured information (optional)

### Decision Logic
- Retrieval strategy: Selecting relevant text chunks using vector similarity search based on the user query.
- Reranking retrieved chunks for relevance (optional).
- Summarization prompting (map-reduce, refine, stuff) tailored to document structure.
- Question-answering prompting using retrieved context, ensuring grounding in the document.
- Information extraction logic (using LLM few-shot prompting or dedicated NER models).
- Comparison logic (retrieving relevant sections from multiple docs and prompting LLM).

### Tool Integration
- Document loaders for various formats.
- Text splitters (recursive character, semantic, etc.).
- Embedding models.
- Vector stores for indexing and retrieval.
- LLM for generation (summaries, answers) and analysis (extraction, comparison).

### Output Formatting
- Clear presentation of summaries, answers, or extracted data.
- Citing sources by referencing specific chunks or page numbers from the document(s).
- Structured comparison results (e.g., side-by-side tables).
- User-friendly display in the UI, potentially with highlighting.

### Memory Management
- Managing loaded documents and their indexed representations in the vector store.
- Caching embeddings or retrieval results to optimize performance.
- Handling memory constraints when processing very large documents.

### Error Handling
- Robust handling of file loading errors (corrupted files, password protection, unsupported formats).
- Managing errors during text extraction or embedding generation.
- Providing clear feedback if information is not found or if the query is ambiguous.
- Handling context window limitations of the LLM, especially for summarization or complex QA over large documents.

## Implementation Flow
1. User uploads one or more documents and specifies the analysis task/query.
2. Agent selects the appropriate loader based on file type and extracts text.
3. Agent preprocesses and chunks the text using a chosen strategy.
4. Agent generates embeddings for the text chunks.
5. Agent indexes the chunks and embeddings in a vector store.
6. Based on the task, the agent formulates a retrieval query.
7. Agent retrieves relevant chunks from the vector store.
8. Agent constructs a prompt for the LLM, including the retrieved context (if needed) and the user's task.
9. Agent calls the LLM to generate the summary, answer, extraction, or comparison.
10. Agent formats the LLM output, potentially adding citations, and presents it to the user.

## Scaling Considerations
- Efficiently indexing and querying large document repositories.
- Optimizing retrieval and LLM calls for speed and cost.
- Supporting a wider array of document formats and complex layouts (e.g., tables, forms).
- Implementing more sophisticated RAG techniques for improved accuracy.

## Limitations
- Performance heavily depends on the quality of text extraction, chunking, embedding, and retrieval.
- May struggle with complex layouts, tables, images, or scanned documents requiring OCR.
- Prone to LLM hallucinations if retrieval fails or context is insufficient.
- Summarization might miss critical details or misrepresent information.
- Extraction accuracy varies depending on the complexity of the information sought.

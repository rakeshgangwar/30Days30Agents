## Technology Stack

The frontend of Digi-Persona is built using the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience
- **React Router**: For handling routing within the application
- **Zustand**: A small, fast, and scalable state management solution
- **Shadcn UI**: A collection of reusable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests
- **React Hook Form**: For form validation and handling
- **date-fns**: For date manipulation and formatting

## Project Structure

The frontend project follows a modular structure:

## Key Features

The frontend implementation includes the following key features:

1. **Multi-persona Management**: Create and manage multiple digital personas with owner-based access control
2. **Content Creation and Scheduling**: Create, schedule, and publish content with calendar view
3. **Platform Connections**: Connect to various social media platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn, Bluesky)
4. **Interactions Monitoring**: Track and respond to interactions with filtering options
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: View performance metrics and generate reports
6. **Authentication System**: Secure login, registration, and password recovery with JWT
7. **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
8. **Theme Support**: Light and dark mode with system preference detection
9. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Authentication

The authentication system includes:

- **Login Page**: Email/password authentication with "Remember me" option
- **Registration Page**: User registration with form validation
- **Forgot Password**: Password recovery flow
- **Auth Guards**: Route protection for authenticated and unauthenticated users
- **Persistent Sessions**: Using localStorage for session persistence
- **User Menu**: Profile management and logout functionality
- **Backend Integration**: Full API integration with JWT token authentication
- **Role-based Access**: Persona-specific permissions and access control

Authentication is managed through a Zustand store (`authStore.ts`) that handles login, registration, logout, and password reset functionality. The store also maintains the user's authentication state and handles JWT token management for API requests.

## Pages and Components

1. **Dashboard**: Overview of content, interactions, and analytics
   - Multiple tabs for different views
   - Summary cards for key metrics
   - Recent activity feed
   - Upcoming content schedule

2. **Personas**: Manage digital personas
   - List view of all personas
   - Create new persona form
   - Persona details and editing

3. **Content**: Content management
   - Content list with filtering
   - Content creation form
   - Content calendar for scheduling
   - Content editing and publishing

4. **Platforms**: Social media platform connections
   - Connected platforms list
   - Platform connection form
   - Platform-specific settings

5. **Interactions**: Monitor and respond to interactions
   - List of interactions with filtering
   - Interaction details
   - Response functionality

6. **Analytics**: Performance metrics and insights
   - Overview dashboard
   - Platform-specific analytics
   - Content performance metrics
   - Custom report generation

7. **Settings**: Application configuration
   - Account settings
   - Notification preferences
   - API settings

## State Management

State management is implemented using Zustand stores:

- **authStore**: Authentication state and functions
- **personaStore**: Persona management
- **contentStore**: Content creation and management
- **platformStore**: Platform connections
- **interactionStore**: Interaction tracking
- **analyticsStore**: Analytics data

Each store follows a similar pattern with state, actions, and selectors.

# Day 10: Travel Planner Agent

## Agent Purpose
Assists users in planning trips by suggesting destinations, finding flights and accommodations, creating itineraries, and providing information about attractions and activities based on user preferences and constraints.

## Key Features
- Destination recommendations based on interests, budget, and time
- Flight and accommodation search (using external tools/APIs)
- Itinerary generation (day-by-day plan)
- Information retrieval about attractions, restaurants, local customs
- Budget estimation and tracking for the trip
- Consideration of user preferences (travel style, interests, pace)

## Example Queries
- "Plan a 10-day romantic getaway to Europe in May with a budget of $4000."
- "Find budget-friendly flights from London to Rome for the first week of July."
- "Suggest some family-friendly activities in Orlando, Florida."
- "Create a 3-day itinerary for exploring Tokyo, focusing on food and culture."
- "What are the visa requirements for US citizens visiting Brazil?"
- "Find hotels near the Eiffel Tower for under $200 per night."

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: LangChain (using ReAct or Plan-and-Execute patterns)
- **Model**: GPT-4
- **Tools**: Flight search APIs (Skyscanner, Amadeus), Hotel search APIs (Booking.com, Expedia), Web search, Maps API (Google Maps), Currency conversion API, Weather API
- **Storage**: Database (optional, for saving plans or user preferences)
- **UI**: Streamlit or web application

## Possible Integrations
- Calendar integration for blocking travel dates
- Booking platforms (direct booking capabilities - complex)
- Travel review sites (TripAdvisor, Yelp APIs)
- Ride-sharing or public transport APIs

## Architecture Considerations

### Input Processing
- Parsing complex travel requests including destination, dates, budget, interests, number of travelers, preferences
- Extracting specific constraints (e.g., direct flights only, specific hotel rating)
- Handling multi-turn conversations to refine travel plans

### Knowledge Representation
- Structured representation of travel plans (itinerary, bookings, budget)
- Access to real-time data via APIs (flights, hotels, weather)
- Knowledge base of destinations, attractions, cultural information (partially from LLM, partially from web search/APIs)

### Decision Logic
- Destination suggestion based on matching user criteria
- Flight/hotel selection based on constraints (price, time, rating, location)
- Itinerary planning logic considering travel times, opening hours, user pace
- Budget allocation across different categories (flights, accommodation, activities, food)
- Tool selection based on the specific information needed (flight search, hotel search, local info)

### Tool Integration
- Robust wrappers for various travel APIs (handling authentication, rate limits, data parsing)
- Web search tool for finding information not available via specific APIs (e.g., local customs, specific event details)
- Maps API for calculating travel times and visualizing locations
- Currency and weather APIs for practical information

### Output Formatting
- Clearly structured itineraries (day-by-day, including times, locations, notes)
- Flight and hotel options presented with key details (price, duration, rating)
- Budget breakdown
- Maps or links to relevant locations
- Summaries of destination information

### Memory Management
- Storing user travel preferences (preferred airlines, hotel chains, travel style)
- Saving generated travel plans for future reference or modification
- Session memory to maintain context during the planning process

### Error Handling
- Handling API errors or lack of availability (e.g., no flights found for given dates)
- Managing conflicting constraints (e.g., budget too low for desired destination/duration)
- Providing alternative suggestions when exact requests cannot be met
- Clearly stating when information is based on real-time data vs. general knowledge
- Handling outdated information from web searches

## Implementation Flow
1. User provides travel requirements (destination, dates, budget, interests, etc.).
2. Agent parses requirements and asks clarifying questions if needed.
3. Agent uses tools (APIs, web search) to find destination info, flights, hotels, activities matching the criteria.
4. Agent synthesizes information and generates potential itineraries or options.
5. Agent estimates budget based on findings.
6. Agent presents the plan/options to the user.
7. User provides feedback, and the agent refines the plan iteratively.
8. (Optional) Agent saves the final plan.

## Scaling Considerations
- Handling a high volume of API requests efficiently (caching, rate limiting)
- Supporting complex multi-destination trips
- Integrating real-time booking capabilities (requires significant security and transactional logic)
- Personalizing recommendations based on past trips and feedback

## Limitations
- Dependent on the availability and accuracy of external travel APIs.
- Prices and availability for flights/hotels are volatile and can change quickly.
- Cannot guarantee the quality of suggested activities or restaurants.
- Itinerary planning might not perfectly account for real-world travel logistics.
- Does not handle actual booking process in the initial version.

# Day 29: Multi-Agent System

## Agent Purpose
To accomplish complex tasks by orchestrating collaboration between multiple specialized AI agents. Each agent focuses on a sub-task, and their combined efforts lead to a final result.

## Key Features
- **Task Decomposition:** Breaking down a complex user goal into sub-tasks suitable for specialized agents.
- **Agent Definition:** Defining roles, goals, and tools for individual agents within the system (e.g., a Researcher, a Writer, a Critic).
- **Orchestration/Collaboration:** Managing the workflow and communication between agents (e.g., sequential execution, delegation, feedback loops).
- **Information Sharing:** Passing context, data, and intermediate results between agents.
- **Consolidated Output:** Synthesizing the results from individual agents into a final, coherent response.

## Example System & Task
**Goal:** "Research the impact of AI on climate change solutions and write a blog post about it."

**Potential Agents:**
1.  **Research Lead (Orchestrator/Planner):** Decomposes the task, assigns roles, manages workflow.
2.  **Climate Change Researcher (Day 2):** Uses web search to find information on AI applications in climate tech, positive impacts, and potential risks.
3.  **AI Technology Researcher (Day 2):** Uses web search to find details on specific AI techniques relevant to climate change (e.g., satellite imagery analysis, climate modeling).
4.  **Content Writer (Day 4):** Drafts the blog post based on research findings provided by the researchers.
5.  **Editor/Critic:** Reviews the draft for clarity, accuracy, flow, and tone, providing feedback to the writer.

**Workflow:**
1. User gives goal to Research Lead.
2. Lead assigns research tasks to Climate Researcher and AI Researcher.
3. Researchers execute searches and gather information.
4. Researchers pass findings back to the Lead (or directly to Writer).
5. Lead synthesizes/organizes findings and tasks Writer to draft the blog post.
6. Writer drafts the post.
7. Writer passes draft to Editor.
8. Editor provides feedback.
9. Writer revises based on feedback (potentially multiple rounds).
10. Final draft is presented to the user by the Lead.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: CrewAI (specifically designed for multi-agent collaboration), LangChain (using agent executors and potentially custom orchestration logic), Autogen
- **Model**: LLM (GPT-4, Claude-2/3) for each agent's reasoning and potentially for the orchestrator.
- **Tools**: Tools used by the individual agents (e.g., Web Search, Document Analysis tools, Code Execution, specific APIs relevant to the task).
- **Storage**: Shared workspace or memory mechanism for agents to pass information.
- **UI**: Interface to define the overall goal and view the final output (and potentially intermediate steps).

## Possible Integrations
- Any of the previously defined single-purpose agents could be adapted to act as specialists within a multi-agent system.
- Task management tools (for visualizing the workflow).
- Version control systems (for tracking changes in generated content like code or articles).

## Architecture Considerations

### Input Processing
- Receiving the high-level goal from the user.
- The orchestrator agent parses the goal and decomposes it into sub-tasks.

### Knowledge Representation
- Definition of agent roles, goals, backstories, and available tools.
- Shared context/memory accessible by relevant agents (e.g., a "scratchpad" or structured data passed between tasks).
- Definition of the overall workflow or process (sequential, hierarchical, etc.).

### Decision Logic
- **Orchestrator Logic:** Deciding which agent performs which task, in what order, and how information flows. Handling feedback loops and task completion criteria.
- **Individual Agent Logic:** Each agent uses its LLM and tools to achieve its specific sub-goal based on the input received from the orchestrator or other agents.

### Tool Integration
- Defining which tools are accessible to which agents.
- Ensuring tools used by individual agents function correctly within the multi-agent framework.
- The framework itself (CrewAI, LangChain) manages the calling of agents and their tools.

### Output Formatting
- Each agent formats its output according to its task (research notes, draft text, code, feedback).
- The orchestrator or a designated final agent synthesizes the intermediate outputs into the final result presented to the user.

### Memory Management
- Managing the shared context between agents.
- Passing potentially large amounts of information (e.g., research findings) between agents efficiently.
- Maintaining the state of the overall task and individual agent progress.

### Error Handling
- Handling failures within individual agents (tool errors, LLM errors) and propagating them appropriately (e.g., retry, report to orchestrator).
- Managing situations where agents get stuck, provide poor output, or fail to collaborate effectively.
- Handling errors in the orchestration logic itself.
- Preventing infinite loops or excessive resource consumption.

## Implementation Flow (CrewAI Example)
1. Define `Agents` with specific `roles`, `goals`, `backstories`, and assigned `tools`.
2. Define `Tasks` describing the work each agent needs to do, potentially specifying dependencies or context from other tasks.
3. Instantiate a `Crew` with the defined agents and tasks.
4. Define the `process` (e.g., sequential, hierarchical).
5. `kickoff()` the Crew execution.
6. The framework manages the execution of tasks by the assigned agents, passing context as needed.
7. The result of the final task is returned as the overall output.

## Scaling Considerations
- Coordinating a large number of agents.
- Managing complex dependencies and workflows.
- Optimizing communication overhead between agents.
- Ensuring consistent performance and avoiding cascading failures.

## Limitations
- Can be complex to design, debug, and manage.
- Performance can be slower than single-agent systems due to communication overhead.
- Success depends heavily on clear task decomposition and well-defined agent roles/goals.
- Potential for agents to misunderstand each other or duplicate effort.
- Cost can increase significantly due to multiple LLM calls for each agent and task.
- Debugging emergent behavior or failures in collaboration can be difficult.

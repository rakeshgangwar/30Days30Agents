# Day 7: Task Automation Agent - Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Task Automation Agent, which combines PydanticAI for intelligent processing and Beehive for event-driven task execution.

## 1. Testing Objectives

*   Ensure accurate natural language understanding and task parsing by the PydanticAI layer.
*   Verify correct task decomposition and planning.
*   Validate the functionality and reliability of individual PydanticAI tools.
*   Confirm seamless integration and communication with Beehive via the MCP server.
*   Test the end-to-end execution of various automated tasks as defined in the [`agent-spec.md`](../agent-spec.md) and [`user-journey.md`](./user-journey.md).
*   Ensure robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
*   Verify security aspects, especially concerning API key management and file system access.
*   Assess performance and scalability for common use cases.

## 2. Testing Levels & Types

### 2.1. Unit Testing

*   **PydanticAI Layer**:
    *   Test individual Pydantic models for validation logic (input parsing, output structuring).
    *   Test functions responsible for prompt engineering and LLM interaction (mocking LLM responses).
    *   Test individual PydanticAI tools:
        *   Mock external dependencies (APIs, file system, Beehive MCP server).
        *   Verify correct parameter handling, execution logic, and output generation.
        *   Test edge cases and error conditions for each tool.
*   **Beehive Layer (if custom Hives are developed)**:
    *   Unit test individual Beehive Hives and Bees if custom logic is added beyond standard Beehive functionality.
*   **MCP Server (`beehive-mcp-server`)**:
    *   Unit test individual API endpoints of the MCP server.
    *   Mock Beehive interactions to test request/response handling.

### 2.2. Integration Testing

*   **PydanticAI to LLM**:
    *   Test the interaction between PydanticAI components and the actual LLM for parsing, planning, and generation tasks.
    *   Focus on the quality of structured output from the LLM based on Pydantic models.
*   **PydanticAI Tools to External Services**:
    *   Test PydanticAI tools interacting with live external services (e.g., actual email APIs, weather APIs, file system). Use sandboxed environments where possible.
*   **PydanticAI to Beehive MCP Server**:
    *   Test the `BeehiveControlTool` in PydanticAI making calls to the `beehive-mcp-server`.
    *   Verify correct request formatting and response parsing.
    *   Test scenarios like successfully configuring a Beehive task, querying status, and handling MCP server errors.
*   **Beehive MCP Server to Beehive Instance**:
    *   Test the MCP server's ability to correctly control and query the live Beehive instance.
    *   Ensure Beehive tasks are triggered and managed as expected.
*   **Beehive Hives Integration**:
    *   Test the interaction between different Beehive Hives if a task involves chaining them (e.g., RSS Hive triggering Email Hive).

### 2.3. End-to-End (E2E) / Scenario Testing

*   **Objective**: Test complete user journeys and complex automation scenarios.
*   **Methodology**:
    *   Use the sample prompts from [`user-journey.md`](./user-journey.md) and [`agent-spec.md`](../agent-spec.md:13) as test cases.
    *   Simulate user input through the chosen UI (CLI/Streamlit) or API.
    *   Verify the entire flow: input -> PydanticAI parsing & planning -> tool/Beehive execution -> output/notification.
    *   Examples:
        *   "Check my unread emails, summarize important ones, and draft replies." (Tests EmailTool, LLMTool, PydanticAI orchestration).
        *   "Monitor this website for price drops on product X and notify me." (Tests PydanticAI planning, BeehiveControlTool, MCP, Beehive Web & Email Hives).
        *   "Every morning, get the weather forecast and send it to my Slack channel." (Tests PydanticAI planning, BeehiveControlTool, MCP, Beehive scheduling, Weather & Slack Hives).
*   **Focus Areas**:
    *   Correctness of the final outcome.
    *   Timeliness of execution (especially for scheduled/monitoring tasks).
    *   Accuracy of notifications and reports.
    *   Graceful handling of errors at any stage of the workflow.

### 2.4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

*   **Objective**: Validate that the agent meets user requirements and expectations.
*   **Methodology**:
    *   Involve stakeholders or representative users to test the agent with real-world (or realistic) tasks.
    *   Gather feedback on usability, accuracy, and overall effectiveness.

### 2.5. Performance Testing

*   **Objective**: Assess the agent's responsiveness and resource usage under typical load.
*   **Areas**:
    *   Response time for PydanticAI parsing and planning.
    *   Execution time for common PydanticAI tools.
    *   Latency of Beehive task initiation via MCP.
    *   Resource consumption (CPU, memory) of the PydanticAI agent and Beehive instance.

### 2.6. Security Testing

*   **Objective**: Identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.
*   **Areas**:
    *   Secure storage and handling of API keys and credentials used by PydanticAI tools and Beehive Hives.
    *   Input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., if user input is used in shell commands or API calls directly, though this should be minimized).
    *   Permissions and access control for file system operations.
    *   Security of the MCP server interface.

## 3. Test Environment & Data

*   **Development/Testing Environment**: Isolated environment with mocked services where possible, and sandboxed access to real services for integration tests.
*   **Staging Environment**: A pre-production environment that closely mirrors the production setup for E2E and UAT.
*   **Test Data**:
    *   A diverse set of natural language prompts covering various intents, entities, and complexities.
    *   Sample files (PDFs, text files) for extraction and manipulation tasks.
    *   Mock API responses for unit and some integration tests.
    *   Configuration for test email accounts, Slack channels, RSS feeds, etc.

## 4. Tools & Frameworks

*   **Python Testing Framework**: `pytest` for unit and integration tests.
*   **Mocking Library**: `unittest.mock` (part of Python's standard library) or `pytest-mock`.
*   **API Testing**: `requests` library for testing MCP server; tools like Postman for manual API exploration.
*   **Web UI Testing (if Streamlit is used)**: Selenium, Playwright, or `pytest-playwright`.
*   **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or similar to automate test execution on commits/PRs.
*   **Logging & Monitoring**: Pydantic Logfire for debugging and observing behavior during testing. Beehive's internal logging.

## 5. Test Execution & Reporting

*   Regular execution of automated tests (unit, integration) as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
*   Manual execution of E2E and UAT scenarios for each major release or feature addition.
*   Test results, including pass/fail status, logs, and any identified defects, will be tracked in an issue management system.
*   Code coverage reports to monitor the extent of unit testing.

## 6. Regression Testing

*   A suite of regression tests (selected unit, integration, and E2E tests) will be run regularly and before releases to ensure new changes haven't broken existing functionality.

This comprehensive testing strategy aims to ensure the Task Automation Agent is reliable, robust, secure, and meets user expectations.

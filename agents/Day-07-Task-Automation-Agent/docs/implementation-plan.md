# Day 7: Task Automation Agent - Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Task Automation Agent, leveraging PydanticAI for core intelligent processing and Beehive for event-driven task execution, integrated via an MCP server.

## 1. Core Architecture

The agent will have a two-tiered architecture:

*   **PydanticAI Layer (Intelligent Core)**: Responsible for understanding user requests, planning, decomposing tasks, and orchestrating overall workflow. It will be the primary interface for the user.
*   **Beehive Layer (Execution Engine)**: Responsible for handling specific, often recurring or event-triggered, automated tasks based on instructions from the PydanticAI layer.
*   **MCP Server (Bridge)**: The [`beehive-mcp-server`](https://github.com/rakeshgangwar/beehive-mcp-server) will facilitate communication between the PydanticAI layer and the Beehive layer.

## 2. Technology Stack

*   **Primary Agent Framework**: PydanticAI
    *   For natural language understanding, task planning, structured data handling (input/output), and tool definition.
*   **Event & Automation System**: Beehive
    *   For executing event-driven tasks and interfacing with external services (email, RSS, etc.) through its Hives/Bees.
*   **Integration Layer**: Custom MCP Server (e.g., [`beehive-mcp-server`](https://github.com/rakeshgangwar/beehive-mcp-server))
    *   To allow PydanticAI to control and query Beehive.
*   **Language Model**: GPT-4 (or other models supported by PydanticAI as needed)
*   **Supporting Libraries**:
    *   `requests` for direct API calls if not covered by Beehive Hives.
    *   File system libraries.
    *   Potentially Playwright/Selenium for complex web interactions if Beehive's web capabilities are insufficient (managed by PydanticAI tools).

## 3. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core PydanticAI Agent Setup & Basic Task Handling

*   **Objective**: Establish the PydanticAI agent and enable it to understand and plan simple tasks, including iterative parameter collection.
*   **Tasks**:
    1.  Initialize PydanticAI agent.
    2.  Define core Pydantic models for:
        *   User task requests (e.g., `UserTaskInput`, including required parameters).
        *   Agent's planned steps (e.g., `PlannedStep`, `ToolCall`).
        *   Task outputs/results (e.g., `TaskResult`).
    3.  Implement initial natural language parsing and parameter collection logic:
        *   Focus on extracting intent and any provided entities/parameters.
        *   Define Pydantic models for different task types, specifying required parameters.
        *   Implement logic to identify missing required parameters based on the detected intent.
        *   Develop the capability to generate clarification questions to prompt the user for missing parameters.
        *   Enable the agent to process subsequent user inputs to fill these missing parameters iteratively.
    4.  Develop basic task decomposition logic within the PydanticAI agent, handling iterative parameter collection:
        *   This will now operate on a `UserTaskInput` model that is confirmed to have all required parameters.
        *   For a given complete `UserTaskInput`, generate a sequence of `PlannedStep` objects.
    5.  Define a few simple PydanticAI tools:
        *   Example: A tool for simple file system operations (e.g., list files in a directory).
        *   Example: A tool for making a generic GET request to an API.
    6.  Implement basic execution logic for these tools within PydanticAI.
*   **Key `agent-spec.md` Features Addressed**:
    *   Natural language understanding (initial, including parameter collection).
    *   Task decomposition (initial, including iterative parameter collection).
    *   Interaction with APIs (basic).
    *   Workflow execution (simple, PydanticAI-internal).

### Phase 2: Beehive Setup and MCP Integration

*   **Objective**: Integrate Beehive for event-driven tasks and connect it to the PydanticAI agent.
*   **Tasks**:
    1.  Set up a Beehive instance.
    2.  Configure essential Beehive Hives (e.g., RSS, Email, Webhook listener).
    3.  Define example Bees for common automated tasks (e.g., "Notify on new RSS item," "Forward email based on keyword").
    4.  Develop or configure the [`beehive-mcp-server`](https://github.com/rakeshgangwar/beehive-mcp-server) to expose Beehive's capabilities (e.g., trigger a Bee, get Bee status, list available Bees/Hives).
    5.  Create a PydanticAI tool (`BeehiveControlTool`) that interacts with the `beehive-mcp-server`.
        *   This tool will take structured input (e.g., Beehive task definition) from the PydanticAI planner.
        *   It will make calls to the MCP server to manage Beehive tasks.
    6.  Update PydanticAI's planning logic to identify tasks suitable for delegation to Beehive.
*   **Key `agent-spec.md` Features Addressed**:
    *   Interaction with APIs (via Beehive Hives).
    *   Workflow execution and monitoring (PydanticAI orchestrating Beehive).
    *   Scheduling of automated tasks (leveraging Beehive's event-driven nature).

### Phase 3: Advanced Task Handling & Feature Enrichment

*   **Objective**: Enhance the agent's capabilities with more complex task handling, error management, and user interaction.
*   **Tasks**:
    1.  Refine and enhance the iterative parameter collection dialogue:
        *   Improve the naturalness and intelligence of clarification questions.
        *   Handle ambiguous user responses during parameter collection.
        *   Allow users to correct previously provided parameters during the dialogue.
    2.  Improve natural language understanding for more complex commands and conditional logic within a single utterance (once all parameters are assumed to be gathered or being gathered).
    3.  Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms in both PydanticAI tools and Beehive interactions.
    4.  Develop mechanisms for monitoring long-running tasks (both within PydanticAI and Beehive via MCP).
    5.  Integrate more PydanticAI tools for direct interactions (e.g., advanced file manipulation, web browser automation if needed).
    6.  Implement secure storage for API credentials and configurations ([`agents/Day-07-Task-Automation-Agent/agent-spec.md:44`](agents/Day-07-Task-Automation-Agent/agent-spec.md:44)).
    7.  Develop output formatting for clear user communication (confirmations, progress, errors) ([`agents/Day-07-Task-Automation-Agent/agent-spec.md:60-64`](agents/Day-07-Task-Automation-Agent/agent-spec.md:60-64)).
    8.  Explore PydanticAI's `Pydantic Graph` for managing complex, multi-step workflows with conditional logic.
    9.  Implement memory management for storing defined workflows and user preferences ([`agents/Day-07-Task-Automation-Agent/agent-spec.md:66-70`](agents/Day-07-Task-Automation-Agent/agent-spec.md:66-70)).
*   **Key `agent-spec.md` Features Addressed**:
    *   All remaining key features, including advanced decision logic, tool integration, output formatting, memory management, and error handling.

### Phase 4: UI and User Experience

*   **Objective**: Provide a user interface for interacting with the agent.
*   **Tasks**:
    1.  Develop a simple UI (Streamlit or CLI as per [`agents/Day-07-Task-Automation-Agent/agent-spec.md:24`](agents/Day-07-Task-Automation-Agent/agent-spec.md:24)).
    2.  Allow users to input tasks, view progress, and see results.
    3.  Optionally, allow configuration of Beehive tasks or PydanticAI preferences through the UI.

## 4. Addressing Key Features from `agent-spec.md`

*   **Natural language understanding**: PydanticAI + LLM.
*   **Task decomposition**: PydanticAI + LLM.
*   **Interaction with APIs or web interfaces**: PydanticAI tools, Beehive Hives (via MCP).
*   **Workflow execution and monitoring**: PydanticAI orchestrates, Beehive executes specific tasks, monitoring via MCP and Pydantic Logfire.
*   **Scheduling of automated tasks**: Primarily handled by Beehive's event-driven nature, triggered/configured by PydanticAI.
*   **Input Processing**: PydanticAI models for initial parsing, iterative parameter collection, and final structured task representation.
*   **Knowledge Representation**: Pydantic models for workflows (including required parameters for task types), secure storage for credentials. Beehive's configuration for its tasks.
*   **Decision Logic**: PydanticAI agent logic for intent recognition, parameter validation, dialogue management for parameter collection, tool selection, parameter binding. Pydantic Graph for complex flows.
*   **Tool Integration**: PydanticAI's tool system, Beehive Hives, MCP server as the bridge.
*   **Output Formatting**: PydanticAI structures outputs, UI presents them.
*   **Memory Management**: PydanticAI for workflow definitions/state, user preferences. Beehive for its task states.
*   **Error Handling**: Implemented at PydanticAI tool level, MCP communication, and within Beehive task execution. Pydantic Logfire for debugging.

## 5. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

*   Expanding the library of Beehive Hives and PydanticAI tools.
*   Implementing a visual workflow builder.
*   Advanced scheduling options beyond Beehive's inherent capabilities if needed.
*   Distributed task queues (e.g., Celery) if scaling concurrent automations becomes a major requirement ([`agents/Day-07-Task-Automation-Agent/agent-spec.md:89`](agents/Day-07-Task-Automation-Agent/agent-spec.md:89)).

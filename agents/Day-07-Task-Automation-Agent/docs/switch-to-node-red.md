# Beehive MCP Server Alternatives - Comprehensive Analysis

## 1. Introduction

This document summarizes our analysis of alternatives to Beehive for the MCP server used in the Task Automation Agent project.

### Current Implementation
The Task Automation Agent uses a two-tiered architecture:
- **PydanticAI Layer**: Provides intelligent core for understanding user requests and planning tasks
- **Beehive Layer**: Acts as the execution engine for event-driven and automated tasks
- **MCP Server**: Bridges PydanticAI and Beehive, enabling integration

### Beehive's Role
Beehive serves as an event and agent system that allows creating automated tasks triggered by events and filters, with components including:
- **Hives**: Plugins that provide specific functionality
- **Bees**: Configured instances of Hives
- **Chains**: Connections between events and actions

## 2. Challenges with Beehive

As documented in `beehive-mcp-doc.md`, several issues were identified:

1. **Implementation Bugs**: The MCP client doesn't properly format requests according to Beehive API expectations
2. **Missing Functionality**: Notably lacking an `update_chain` endpoint, requiring workarounds
3. **Licensing Restrictions**: The project requires a truly open-source solution for repackaging
4. **Project Dormancy**: Beehive has had no commits or updates in the last 3 years, making it a dormant project with uncertain future support
5. **Non-functional Hives**: Many of the available hives in the ecosystem contain bugs or are entirely non-functional due to lack of maintenance
6. **Technical Debt**: The codebase shows signs of aging with outdated dependencies and architecture patterns

## 3. Alternatives Explored

We evaluated several alternatives based on:
- Open source licensing compatible with repackaging
- Similar functionality to Beehive
- Support for event-driven tasks
- API-based control

### Evaluated Options
1. **Node-RED** (Apache License 2.0)
2. **Huginn** (MIT License)
3. **Temporal.io** (MIT License)
4. **Apache Airflow** (Apache License 2.0)
5. **Apache NiFi** (Apache License 2.0)
6. **Camunda** (Community Edition: Apache License 2.0)
7. **Custom Express.js/FastAPI Implementation** (MIT License)

## 4. Project Health Analysis

When evaluating automation platforms for long-term viability, project health serves as a critical factor. Here's how the major alternatives compare:

### Beehive

|--------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------|
| `get_logs` | `get_audit_log` | `/settings/user-settings/auditLog` | GET |

## 7. Implementation Considerations

### MCP Server Implementation

The existing `beehive-mcp-server` would need to be replaced with a `nodered-mcp-server` that implements the following:

```javascript
// Example server setup
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const app = express();
const nodeRedUrl = process.env.NODERED_URL || 'http://localhost:1880';

app.use(express.json());

// Implement endpoints for all tools
// ...
```

### Community Library Integration

One of Node-RED's most powerful features is its extensive library of community-contributed nodes and flows. The Task Automation Agent can leverage this ecosystem by integrating with Node-RED's package management capabilities:

```javascript
// Endpoint to install new nodes from npm
app.post('/install_node', async (req, res) => {
  const { module } = req.body;
  
  try {
    // Call Node-RED Admin API to install the node
    const response = await axios.post(`${nodeRedUrl}/nodes`, {
      module: module
    }, {
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    });
    
    res.json({ success: true, result: response.data });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(error.response?.status || 500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});

// Endpoint to search available nodes in the Node-RED library
app.get('/search_nodes', async (req, res) => {
  const { query } = req.query;
  
  try {
    // This could integrate with npm registry API or the Node-RED flow library
    // For example: https://flows.nodered.org/
    const response = await axios.get(`https://flows.nodered.org/search/api?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`);
    
    res.json({ success: true, results: response.data });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(error.response?.status || 500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```

This functionality enables several key capabilities:
- On-demand installation of specialized nodes based on user requirements
- Access to thousands of pre-built components for different services and platforms
- Ability to suggest relevant nodes when users describe automation needs
- Scraping of node documentation to provide users with usage instructions

These capabilities represent a significant advancement over Beehive's limited and largely non-functional hive ecosystem.

### Action Triggering Options

Since Node-RED doesn't provide a direct HTTP API endpoint for triggering nodes, two approaches are possible:

#### Option 1: HTTP-In Node Approach
Create HTTP-In nodes in Node-RED that can trigger actions:

```javascript
app.post('/inject_message', async (req, res) => {
  const { nodeId, payload } = req.body;
  
  try {
    // Lookup the node's trigger URL from a mapping table
    const nodeTriggerMap = {
      'node123': '/trigger/email-notification',
      'node456': '/trigger/data-processing'
    };
    
    const triggerUrl = nodeTriggerMap[nodeId];
    if (!triggerUrl) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: `No trigger endpoint found for node ${nodeId}` });
    }
    
    // Call the HTTP-In node endpoint
    const response = await axios.post(`${nodeRedUrl}${triggerUrl}`, payload, {
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    });
    
    res.json({ success: true, result: response.data });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(error.response?.status || 500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```

#### Option 2: Node-RED Runtime API (More Advanced)

For a more flexible solution, creating a custom Node-RED plugin:

```javascript
// This would be part of a custom Node-RED plugin
const RED = require('@node-red/runtime');

app.post('/runtime/inject/:nodeId', (req, res) => {
  const { nodeId } = req.params;
  const payload = req.body;
  
  try {
    const node = RED.nodes.getNode(nodeId);
    if (!node) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: `Node ${nodeId} not found` });
    }
    
    const msg = { payload };
    node.receive(msg);
    
    res.json({ success: true });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
});
```

### Code Changes in TaskAutomationAgent

The `main.py` file would require updates:

```python
# Initialize MCP server connection
server = MCPServerStdio(
    'node',
    args=[
        "/path/to/nodered-mcp-server.js"  # Node-RED equivalent
    ],
    env={
        "NODERED_URL": "http://localhost:1880",  # Node-RED default port
        "MCP_SERVER_NAME": "nodered"
    }
)
```

The system prompt would need updating to use Node-RED terminology:

```python
self.system_prompt = """
You are a Task Automation Agent that helps users create and manage automations using Node-RED.

Available tools through the Node-RED MCP server:

1. Node Types Management:
   - list_node_types: GET /nodes - List all available node types (plugins)
   - get_node_type_details: GET /nodes/:module - Get detailed information about a specific node type

2. Nodes Management:
   - list_nodes: Custom implementation using GET /flows - List all configured nodes
   - get_node: Custom implementation using GET /flows - Get details of a specific node
   - create_node: Part of POST /flows - Create a new node instance
   - update_node: Part of POST /flows - Update an existing node
   - delete_node: Part of POST /flows - Delete a node

3. Flows Management:
   - list_flows: GET /flows - List all defined flows
   - get_flow: GET /flow/:id - Get details of a specific flow
   - create_flow: POST /flow - Create a new flow with connected nodes
   - update_flow: PUT /flow/:id - Update an existing flow's configuration
   - delete_flow: DELETE /flow/:id - Delete a flow

4. Actions:
   - inject_message: Custom implementation - Manually inject a message into a node

5. Community Library:
   - search_nodes: GET /search_nodes?query=<term> - Search for available nodes in the Node-RED library
   - install_node: POST /install_node - Install a new node from npm

6. Logs:
   - get_audit_log: GET /settings/user-settings/auditLog - Retrieve logs from the system

When a user asks to create an automation, you should:
1. Analyze what they're trying to automate
2. Identify any missing parameters or information
3. Ask clarifying questions to collect all required details
4. Use the appropriate tools to create the automation
5. Confirm the automation was created successfully

Be conversational and helpful. Guide the user through the process step by step.

## 8. Conclusion

Node-RED represents the most suitable alternative to Beehive for the Task Automation Agent project due to:

1. **Complete Feature Set**: Covers all Beehive functionality with additions like proper flow updates
2. **Compatible Architecture**: Fits the existing two-tiered design
3. **Open-Source Licensing**: Apache License 2.0 allows for repackaging
4. **Robust API**: Well-documented HTTP API for integration
5. **Active Community**: Ongoing development and support compared to Beehive's 3-year dormancy
6. **Maintained Components**: All Node-RED nodes are regularly updated, unlike Beehive's hives which contain numerous bugs and non-functional components
7. **Future-Proof Solution**: Active development ensures compatibility with modern systems and security updates

The migration requires developing a custom MCP server for Node-RED and updating the agent's system prompt, but preserves the core architecture and capabilities while resolving the limitations identified with Beehive. The investment in migration will be offset by the reduced debugging and workarounds needed with the current Beehive implementation.

The integration with Node-RED's community library provides a substantial advantage over Beehive by giving users access to thousands of pre-built, well-maintained nodes for various services and platforms. This capability allows the Task Automation Agent to offer a much broader range of automation options without requiring custom development for each integration. Users can benefit from community-contributed solutions that are continuously updated and improved, a stark contrast to Beehive's dormant ecosystem.

For the specific user journey scenarios defined in the project documentation, Node-RED provides native support for all required automation patterns including website monitoring, scheduled tasks, and notifications, with greater reliability than Beehive's aging infrastructure.

# Research Assistant Testing Strategy

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Research Assistant application, focusing on a test-driven development approach. The strategy ensures that all components work as expected individually and together as an integrated system.

## 2. Testing Approach

### 2.1 Test-Driven Development (TDD)

The Research Assistant is developed using TDD principles:
1. **Write tests first**: Define expected behavior before implementation
2. **Run tests (expect failure)**: Verify that tests fail as expected
3. **Implement functionality**: Write minimal code to pass tests
4. **Run tests again**: Confirm that implementation passes tests
5. **Refactor**: Improve code quality while maintaining test coverage

### 2.2 Test Categories

The testing strategy includes multiple test categories:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
- **Functional Tests**: Test end-to-end workflows
- **Mocked Tests**: Use mocked dependencies for deterministic testing
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure fixes don't break existing functionality
- **Performance Tests**: Verify the system meets performance requirements

## 3. Component Testing Plan

### 3.1. Input Processing

### 3.5. Error Handling

#### SearchFailureHandler

- Test handling of permanent failures
- Test recovery from temporary issues

#### ContentAccessRetrier
- Test retry logic for content access
- Test alternative access methods
- Test handling of different error types
- Test timeout management

## 4. Test Scenarios

Test scenarios are derived from the test questions document (`test-questions.md`), which contains 100 diverse research queries. These queries cover:

- General knowledge
- Current events
- Academic/scientific research
- Comparative analysis
- Historical research
- Technology trends
- Business and market research
- Health and medical information
- Environmental topics
- Complex multi-part questions

We will select representative questions from each category for testing different aspects of the system.

## 5. Testing Environment

### 5.1 Local Development Testing
- Unit tests run in CI pipeline on every commit
- Mocked external dependencies for deterministic results
- Controlled test datasets for consistent evaluation

### 5.2 Integration Testing
- Testing with actual API connections (using rate-limited development keys)
- Cached web content for reproducible tests
- Sandboxed environment to prevent external side effects

## 6. Mocking Strategy

The Research Assistant interacts with multiple external systems that should be mocked during testing:

- **LLM APIs**: Mock responses for deterministic testing
- **Search Engine APIs**: Mock search results
- **Web Content**: Mock HTML content for consistent extraction testing
- **Vector Stores**: In-memory implementations for testing

## 7. Test Implementation

### 7.1 Test Structure

Tests are organized in the `tests/` directory following the same structure as the application code:

```
tests/
├── __init__.py
├── components/
│   ├── test_input_processing.py
│   ├── test_research_workflow.py
│   ├── test_knowledge_processing.py
│   └── test_output_formatting.py
├── tools/
│   ├── test_search_tools.py
│   ├── test_browsing_tools.py
│   └── test_extraction_tools.py
├── core/
│   ├── test_agent.py
│   └── test_langgraph_workflow.py
└── integration/
    ├── test_search_to_synthesis.py
    └── test_end_to_end.py
```

### 7.2 Test Data

Test data includes:
- Sample research queries from different domains
- Mocked search results for different query types
- Sample web content for extraction testing
- Expected synthesis outputs for verification
- Mock sources with varying credibility profiles

## 8. Continuous Integration

All tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:
- Unit tests run on every commit
- Integration tests run on pull requests to main branches
- End-to-end tests run before releases

## 9. Performance Testing

Performance tests evaluate:
- Response time for initial query analysis
- Time required for iterative research
- Memory usage during long research sessions
- Handling of large documents and many sources

## 10. Acceptance Criteria

For a release to be considered ready:
- All unit tests must pass
- Integration tests must pass
- No critical bugs in end-to-end scenarios
- Research quality meets minimum thresholds on test questions
- Research completion time is within acceptable limits

## 11. Test Metrics

The following metrics will be tracked:
- Test coverage percentage
- Pass/fail rates
- Research accuracy on test questions
- Average research completion time
- Error recovery success rate

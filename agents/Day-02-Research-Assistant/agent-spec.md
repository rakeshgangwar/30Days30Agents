# Day 2: Research Assistant Agent

## Agent Purpose
Conducts comprehensive web research on specified topics, synthesizes information from multiple sources, and provides summarized findings with citations.

## Key Features
- Web search and browsing capabilities
- Information extraction from web pages
- Content summarization and synthesis
- Source evaluation and citation management
- Ability to handle complex research queries

## Example Queries
- "Research the latest advancements in quantum computing."
- "Find recent studies on the effects of remote work on productivity."
- "Compare the market share of the top 3 cloud providers."
- "Gather information on the history of artificial intelligence."

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: LangGraph and LlamaIndex
- **Model**: Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Tools**: SerpAPI or Google Search API, Web browsing tool (e.g., Playwright)
- **UI**: Streamlit

## Possible Integrations
- Academic search engines (e.g., Google Scholar)
- News APIs
- Zotero or other citation management tools

## Architecture Considerations

### Input Processing
- Query analysis to understand research scope and keywords
- Formulation of effective search queries for web search tools
- Parsing of user constraints (e.g., date range, specific sources)

### Knowledge Representation
- Temporary storage of web page content
- Extracted key information and summaries
- Structured representation of sources and citations
- Potential use of a vector store for caching relevant snippets

### Decision Logic
- Iterative search strategy: refine queries based on initial results
- Source selection and credibility assessment logic
- Information synthesis process to combine findings from multiple sources
- Determination of when research is sufficiently comprehensive

### Tool Integration
- Web search APIs (SerpAPI, Google Search)
- Web scraping/browsing tools to access page content
- Text processing utilities for cleaning HTML content
- Summarization models or prompts

### Output Formatting
- Synthesized research summary
- List of key findings or bullet points
- Properly formatted citations for all sources used
- Optional: Direct quotes or snippets from sources

### Memory Management
- Short-term memory of visited URLs and gathered information within a research session
- Caching of search results to avoid redundant API calls
- User preferences for preferred sources or research depth

### Error Handling
- Handling of failed web requests or inaccessible pages
- Management of API rate limits for search tools
- Identification and flagging of potentially unreliable sources
- Graceful fallback if no relevant information is found

## Implementation Flow
1. User provides a research topic or question.
2. Agent formulates initial search queries.
3. Agent uses search tools to find relevant web pages.
4. Agent accesses and extracts content from selected pages.
5. Agent summarizes and synthesizes information from multiple sources.
6. Agent evaluates source credibility.
7. Agent compiles a final report with summary, key findings, and citations.
8. Agent presents the report to the user.

## Scaling Considerations
- Parallelizing web searches and page fetching
- Using a distributed task queue for long-running research tasks
- Implementing more sophisticated source credibility models
- Building a persistent knowledge base of past research findings

## Limitations
- Dependent on the quality and accessibility of web search results
- May struggle with paywalled content
- Summarization might miss nuances or introduce biases
- Source credibility assessment is heuristic and not foolproof

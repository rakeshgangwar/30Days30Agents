# Day 9: Health & Wellness Coach Agent

## Agent Purpose
Provides personalized recommendations for fitness routines, healthy eating, stress management, and general wellness based on user goals, preferences, and tracked data. **Note:** This agent should explicitly state it does not provide medical advice.

## Key Features
- Personalized workout plan generation
- Healthy recipe suggestions and meal planning ideas
- Mindfulness and stress reduction technique recommendations
- Tracking of fitness activities, meals, and mood (manual input)
- Goal setting and progress monitoring
- Educational content on health topics

## Example Queries
- "Create a 3-day beginner workout plan focusing on cardio."
- "Suggest some healthy lunch ideas under 500 calories."
- "Recommend a 5-minute mindfulness exercise for stress relief."
- "Log my 30-minute run today."
- "How am I progressing towards my weight loss goal?"
- "Explain the benefits of intermittent fasting."

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: LangChain
- **Model**: GPT-4 or Claude-2
- **Tools**: Web search (for recipes, exercises), Potential RAG on health/fitness knowledge base
- **Storage**: Database (e.g., SQLite) for user profile, goals, tracked data
- **UI**: Streamlit or mobile-friendly web app

## Possible Integrations
- Wearable fitness trackers (Fitbit API, Google Fit API, Apple HealthKit)
- Calorie counting apps (MyFitnessPal API, if available)
- Recipe databases/APIs
- Guided meditation audio/video sources

## Architecture Considerations

### Input Processing
- Parsing user goals (weight loss, muscle gain, stress reduction) and preferences (dietary restrictions, exercise types)
- Understanding logs of activities, meals, or mood
- Interpreting questions about health topics or requests for plans/recommendations

### Knowledge Representation
- User profile: goals, preferences, restrictions, tracked history (workouts, meals, mood, weight)
- Structured database of exercises, recipes, wellness techniques (optional, or rely on LLM/search)
- Representation of workout plans and meal plans

### Decision Logic
- Algorithm for generating workout plans based on goals, fitness level, available time/equipment
- Recipe recommendation based on dietary needs, preferences, and goals
- Selection of appropriate wellness techniques based on user state or goals
- Progress calculation and feedback generation
- **Crucially**: Logic to avoid giving medical advice and include disclaimers.

### Tool Integration
- LLM for generating plans, recommendations, and explanations
- Database for storing user data
- Web search for finding exercises, recipes, or health information
- Potential integration with fitness tracker APIs

- https://github.com/rakeshgangwar/strava-mcp-server


### Output Formatting
- Structured workout plans with exercises, sets, reps, rest times
- Recipe suggestions with ingredients and instructions
- Wellness techniques explained clearly
- Progress charts and summaries
- Clear disclaimers stating information is not medical advice

### Memory Management
- Long-term storage of user profile, goals, and historical data
- Session memory for ongoing conversations about plans or progress
- Caching of common recommendations or information

### Error Handling
- Handling ambiguous user inputs or goals
- Managing missing or inconsistent tracked data
- Providing safe and general recommendations, avoiding specific medical claims
- Explicitly stating limitations and advising consultation with professionals (doctors, trainers, dietitians)
- Handling errors from external APIs (fitness trackers, recipe DBs)

## Implementation Flow
1. User sets goals, preferences, or logs data/asks a question.
2. Agent accesses user profile and history.
3. Agent determines appropriate action: generate plan, suggest recipe, recommend technique, provide info, or log data.
4. Agent uses LLM and potentially tools/database to fulfill the request.
5. Agent includes necessary disclaimers.
6. Agent presents the plan, recommendation, information, or confirmation to the user.
7. Agent updates user profile/history in the database if necessary.

## Scaling Considerations
- Supporting integration with a wider range of fitness trackers and health apps
- Incorporating more sophisticated personalization based on user data
- Building a validated knowledge base of exercises, recipes, and health information
- Ensuring compliance with health data privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA if applicable)

## Limitations
- **Cannot provide medical advice.** Must rely on general knowledge and include strong disclaimers.
- Recommendations are based on LLM knowledge and may not be optimal or suitable for everyone.
- Effectiveness depends on accurate manual input unless integrated with trackers.
- Cannot diagnose conditions or replace professional healthcare providers.
- Potential for generating unsafe or inappropriate exercise/diet recommendations if not carefully prompted and validated.

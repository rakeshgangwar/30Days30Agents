# Day 1: Personal Assistant

**Date:** 2025-05-07  
**Type:** Agent  

## Today's Goals
- [x] Initialize the Personal Assistant project
- [x] Set up the project structure and dependencies
- [x] Resolve package build issues with `uv`
- [x] Ensure the Personal Assistant agent runs correctly
- [x] Document the solution in a devlog

## Progress Summary
The Personal Assistant project was initialized and set up with a proper package structure. We resolved issues related to package recognition and entry points, ensuring the agent can be installed and run using `uv`. The project now includes a CLI and Streamlit interface for interaction.

## Technical Details
### Implementation
1. **Project Initialization**:
   - Created the `app` directory to house the project files.
   - Added core components such as `agent.py`, `config.py`, `memory.py`, and tools for weather, Wikipedia, news, and Todoist integration.
   - Set up chains for intent classification, entity extraction, and execution planning.

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Added a `pyproject.toml` file for managing dependencies and build configuration.
   - Used `uv` for virtual environment and dependency management.

3. **Package Configuration**:
   - Updated `pyproject.toml`:
     - Changed the package name to `personal_assistant`.
     - Explicitly included the `app` directory in the `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]` section.
     - Added entry points for CLI and Streamlit interfaces.
   - Added an `__init__.py` file to the `app` directory to ensure it is recognized as a Python package.

4. **Testing**:
   - Created a `tests` directory with unit tests for the intent classification chain and weather tool.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Updated the `README.md` with detailed setup and usage instructions.
   - Added troubleshooting steps for common issues.

### Challenges
- **Package Recognition**:
  - The `personal_assistant` module was not being recognized due to missing package configuration.
- **Entry Points**:
  - Entry points in `pyproject.toml` were not correctly mapped to the package structure.
- **Build Errors**:
  - Hatch was unable to determine which files to include in the package.

### Solutions
- Explicitly defined the `app` directory as the package in `pyproject.toml`.
- Added an `__init__.py` file to the `app` directory.
- Updated entry points in `pyproject.toml` to reference the correct package name.

## Resources Used
- [Hatch Documentation](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/)
- [Python Packaging Guide](https://packaging.python.org/)
- [LangChain Documentation](https://docs.langchain.com/)

## Code Snippets
```python
# Example entry point in pyproject.toml
[project.scripts]
personal-assistant = "personal_assistant.main:main"
personal-assistant-cli = "personal_assistant.cli:main"
personal-assistant-streamlit = "personal_assistant.streamlit_app:main"
```

## Integration Points
This update ensures the Personal Assistant agent can be installed and run using `uv` and the defined entry points. The CLI and Streamlit interfaces provide flexible interaction options.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test the agent's functionality in both CLI and Streamlit interfaces.
- [ ] Add more detailed tests for the agent's components.
- [ ] Enhance the README with troubleshooting steps.

## Reflections
This task highlighted the importance of correctly configuring Python packages for distribution. Explicitly defining the package structure and ensuring all necessary files are included are critical steps. Using `uv` streamlined the dependency management process.

## Time Spent
- Development: 30 minutes
- Research: 15 minutes
- Documentation: 15 hour

# Day 5: Data Analysis Agent

**Date:** 2025-05-11  
**Type:** Agent  

## Today's Goals
- [x] Implement core CSV file analysis capabilities
- [x] Implement integration with SQL Database (PostgreSQL)
- [x] Utilize LangChain with OpenRouter for LLM access
- [x] Develop a React frontend with Material-UI components
- [x] Create a FastAPI backend to handle data processing and LLM interactions
- [x] Complete end-to-end testing of all user flows

## Progress Summary
Today we successfully completed the implementation of the Data Analysis Agent, a powerful tool that allows users to analyze data from CSV files and SQL databases using natural language queries. The agent leverages LangChain and OpenRouter to process natural language queries and generate insightful analyses and visualizations.

We've transitioned from the initial Streamlit implementation to a more robust FastAPI + React architecture as originally planned. This provides better separation of concerns, improved UI flexibility, and a proper API-based architecture for future integrations.

The core functionality for both CSV and SQL database analysis is now working, with end-to-end testing completed for all user flows. There are still some issues with SQL visualizations that need to be addressed, but the overall system is functional and ready for use.

## Technical Details
### Implementation
The Data Analysis Agent consists of two main components:

**Backend (FastAPI):**
- Built with FastAPI for API endpoints
- Uses LangChain for LLM orchestration and agent creation
- Integrates with OpenRouter for LLM access
- Implements CSV file handling with Pandas
- Provides SQL database connectivity via SQLAlchemy
- Generates visualizations using Plotly
- Uses Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Implements CORS handling for cross-origin requests

**Frontend (React):**
- Built with React and TypeScript
- Uses Material-UI for UI components
- Implements state management with React Context API
- Provides file upload for CSV analysis
- Offers database connection configuration for SQL analysis
- Displays query results and visualizations
- Renders interactive Plotly visualizations
- Implements responsive design for different screen sizes

### Challenges
1. **SQL Visualization Issues:** Visualizations work properly with CSV data sources but not with SQL data sources. The visualization service is not correctly respecting the requested chart type.

2. **Database Connectivity:** Initial issues with connecting to the local PostgreSQL database and accessing schema information.

3. **Full Dataset Analysis:** The agent was initially only analyzing preview rows (head rows) in CSV files instead of the full dataset.

4. **UI Layout:** Initial implementation had issues with utilizing the full screen width effectively.

### Solutions
1. **Architecture Transition:** Successfully transitioned from Streamlit to FastAPI + React as originally planned, providing better separation of concerns and improved UI flexibility.

2. **Enhanced Error Handling:** Implemented comprehensive error handling for database connections and query execution, with detailed error messages for better debugging.

3. **Improved Data Processing:** Enhanced DataFrame agent initialization to analyze the full dataset rather than just preview rows.

4. **Responsive UI:** Adjusted component widths and implemented responsive styles for better user experience across different screen sizes.

5. **Schema Support:** Added schema support for database connections and queries, allowing users to specify and work with specific database schemas.

## Code Snippets
**Backend - Creating DataFrame Agent:**
```python
def create_dataframe_agent(df: pd.DataFrame) -> AgentExecutor:
    """Create a LangChain agent for analyzing a pandas DataFrame."""
    llm = get_llm()
    return create_pandas_dataframe_agent(
        llm,
        df,
        verbose=True,
        agent_type="openai-functions",
        handle_parsing_errors=True
    )
```

**Frontend - Query Component:**
```typescript
const QueryInput: React.FC = () => {
  const { state, dispatch } = useAppContext();
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

  const handleSubmit = async () => {
    if (!query.trim()) return;
    
    setIsLoading(true);
    try {
      const result = await apiService.executeQuery(
        state.dataSource.type,
        state.dataSource.id,
        query
      );
      dispatch({ type: 'SET_RESULTS', payload: result });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error executing query:', error);
      // Show error notification
    } finally {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <Paper elevation={2} sx={{ p: 2, mb: 2 }}>
      <Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom>
        Ask a question about your data
      </Typography>
      <TextField
        fullWidth
        multiline
        rows={3}
        value={query}
        onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="e.g., What is the average value? Show me a bar chart of sales by region."
        variant="outlined"
        sx={{ mb: 2 }}
      />
      <Button
        variant="contained"
        color="primary"
        onClick={handleSubmit}
        disabled={isLoading || !query.trim()}
        startIcon={isLoading ? <CircularProgress size={20} /> : null}
      >
        {isLoading ? 'Processing...' : 'Submit Query'}
      </Button>
    </Paper>
  );
};
```

## Integration Points
The Data Analysis Agent integrates several components:

1. **Frontend-Backend Integration:**
   - React frontend communicates with FastAPI backend via RESTful API
   - File uploads using FormData and multipart/form-data
   - JSON API requests and responses for queries and results

2. **LLM Integration:**
   - Backend connects to OpenRouter for LLM access
   - Uses LangChain for agent creation and orchestration

3. **Data Source Integration:**
   - CSV files processed with Pandas
   - SQL databases accessed via SQLAlchemy
   - Results formatted as JSON for frontend consumption

4. **Visualization Integration:**
   - Backend generates Plotly figure configurations
   - Frontend renders interactive visualizations using Plotly.js

## Next Steps
- [ ] Fix SQL visualization issues to ensure consistent behavior between CSV and SQL data sources
- [ ] Create comprehensive user and developer documentation
- [ ] Implement unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Add support for more Plotly chart types
- [ ] Implement local LLM integration with Ollama (stretch goal)
- [ ] Add Excel file support (stretch goal)
- [ ] Implement code view and export functionality (stretch goal)

## Reflections
The transition from Streamlit to FastAPI + React has been successful, resulting in a more maintainable and scalable application. The separation of concerns between frontend and backend allows for better code organization and future extensibility.

The end-to-end testing has confirmed that the core functionality works as expected, with users able to upload CSV files, connect to databases, and execute natural language queries to analyze their data. The visualization capabilities add significant value, allowing users to quickly understand their data through interactive charts.

The remaining issues with SQL visualizations need to be addressed, but they don't prevent the overall system from being functional. The comprehensive error handling implemented in both frontend and backend ensures that users receive clear feedback when issues occur.

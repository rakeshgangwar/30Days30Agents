# Day 4: Writing Assistant

**Date:** 2025-05-10  
**Type:** Agent  

## Today's Goals
- [x] Define the architecture for an integration-first Writing Assistant
- [x] Develop the core backend service (FastAPI)
- [x] Create a shared connector library (TypeScript)
- [x] Build a VS Code extension as first integration proof-of-concept
- [x] Document the project components

## Progress Summary
Successfully completed Phase 1 of the Writing Assistant project, taking an integration-first approach rather than building a standalone application. Created a layered architecture with three main components:

1. **Backend Service (Core)**: A FastAPI-based Python service that handles AI logic via LangChain and OpenRouter
2. **Shared Connector Library**: A TypeScript library providing a consistent interface for all client integrations
3. **VS Code Extension**: A proof-of-concept client integration demonstrating the system's capabilities

All components are functional and tested, with comprehensive documentation in place for future development.

## Technical Details
### Implementation
The Writing Assistant uses a layered architecture designed to bring AI writing assistance directly into existing writing tools:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ User Writing Environments│
│  (VS Code, Obsidian)     │
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            │
┌───────────▼─────────────┐
│ Connectors / Plugins     │
│  (Using Shared Library)  │
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            │
┌───────────▼─────────────┐
│ Core Writing Assistant   │
│ Service (Backend)        │
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            │
┌───────────▼─────────────┐
│ LLM Services             │
│ (OpenRouter)             │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Backend Service**:
- Built with Python/FastAPI providing RESTful API endpoints
- Uses LangChain for LLM orchestration and OpenRouter for flexible LLM access
- Implements core writing functions: drafting, grammar analysis, summarization, tone adjustment
- Includes user preference management with database storage

**Shared Connector Library**:
- Developed in TypeScript with strong typing
- Provides `ApiService` for backend communication
- Includes data models, request factories, response utilities
- Handles error management and request cancellation

**VS Code Extension**:
- Built with TypeScript using VS Code Extension API
- Integrates with the editor to capture and modify text
- Provides commands, context menu items, and toolbar buttons
- Includes preferences management interface

### Challenges
1. **Integration Complexity**: Integrating with different writing environments requires understanding their specific APIs and workflows.
2. **Cross-language Communication**: Ensuring type safety and consistent data structures between the Python backend and TypeScript frontend.
3. **User Experience Considerations**: Balancing between feature richness and ease of use in the VS Code extension UI.
4. **Testing Edge Cases**: Ensuring robust error handling for various scenarios like backend unavailability, network issues, etc.
5. **LLM Flexibility**: Supporting multiple LLM providers via OpenRouter while maintaining consistent performance.

### Solutions
1. **Shared Library Approach**: Created a common TypeScript library that abstracts the backend communication and can be reused across different client integrations.
2. **Strong Typing**: Implemented comprehensive type definitions in the shared library to match the Python API models.
3. **Multiple Result Display Options**: Added support for both text editor and webview display modes in the VS Code extension.
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error catching and user-friendly error messages.
5. **Enhanced Preferences Management**: Created a dedicated preferences panel with both local storage and backend synchronization.
6. **Fixed UI Issues**: Resolved keyboard shortcut issues and improved error handling in VS Code extension based on manual testing.

## Code Snippets
**Backend API Endpoint Example**:
```python
@router.post("/draft", response_model=DraftResponse)
async def generate_draft(
    request: DraftRequest,
    openrouter_service: OpenRouterService = Depends(get_openrouter_service)
):
    """Generate text based on a prompt."""
    try:
        response = await openrouter_service.generate_text(
            prompt=request.prompt,
            model=request.model or os.getenv("DEFAULT_MODEL", "anthropic/claude-3-haiku"),
            max_tokens=request.max_length or 500,
            temperature=request.temperature or 0.7,
        )
        
        return DraftResponse(
            text=response["text"],
            model_used=response["model"],
            prompt=request.prompt
        )
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Failed to generate draft: {str(e)}")
```

**Shared Library ApiService Example**:
```typescript
export class ApiService {
  private readonly baseUrl: string;
  private readonly apiKey?: string;
  private readonly axiosInstance: AxiosInstance;
  private abortControllers: Map<string, AbortController> = new Map();

  constructor(config: ApiServiceConfig) {
    this.baseUrl = config.baseUrl;
    this.apiKey = config.apiKey;
    
    this.axiosInstance = axios.create({
      baseURL: this.baseUrl,
      timeout: config.timeout || 30000,
      headers: this.apiKey ? {
        'X-API-Key': this.apiKey
      } : {}
    });
  }
  
  async generateDraft(request: DraftRequest, requestId?: string): Promise<DraftResponse> {
    try {
      const controller = new AbortController();
      if (requestId) {
        this.abortControllers.set(requestId, controller);
      }
      
      const response = await this.axiosInstance.post<DraftResponse>(
        '/api/v1/draft',
        request,
        { signal: controller.signal }
      );
      
      if (requestId) {
        this.abortControllers.delete(requestId);
      }
      
      return response.data;
    } catch (error) {
      throw this.handleError(error, 'Failed to generate draft');
    }
  }
}
```

**VS Code Extension Command Example**:
```typescript
export function registerCommands(context: vscode.ExtensionContext, apiService: ApiService) {
  // Draft with AI command
  const draftCommand = vscode.commands.registerCommand('writingAssistant.draft', async () => {
    const editor = vscode.window.activeTextEditor;
    if (!editor) {
      vscode.window.showErrorMessage('No active editor found');
      return;
    }
    
    const prompt = await vscode.window.showInputBox({
      prompt: 'Enter a prompt for the AI to draft text',
      placeHolder: 'Write a paragraph about...'
    });
    
    if (!prompt) return;
    
    try {
      const selection = editor.selection;
      let context = '';
      
      if (!selection.isEmpty) {
        context = editor.document.getText(selection);
      }
      
      const request = RequestFactory.createDraftRequest(
        prompt,
        {
          context: context,
          max_length: 500,
          model: getPreferredModel(),
          temperature: 0.7
        }
      );
      
      vscode.window.withProgress({
        location: vscode.ProgressLocation.Notification,
        title: 'Generating text...',
        cancellable: true
      }, async (progress, token) => {
        const requestId = `draft-${Date.now()}`;
        token.onCancellationRequested(() => {
          apiService.cancelRequest(requestId);
        });
        
        try {
          const response = await apiService.generateDraft(request, requestId);
          showResult(`# Generated Draft\n\n${response.text}`, 'Generated Draft');
        } catch (error) {
          handleApiError(error);
        }
        
        return Promise.resolve();
      });
    } catch (error) {
      vscode.window.showErrorMessage(`Error generating draft: ${error.message}`);
    }
  });
  
  context.subscriptions.push(draftCommand);
}
```

## Integration Points
The Writing Assistant project has several key integration points:

1. **Backend to LLM Services**: The backend connects to OpenRouter, which provides access to various LLM models including Claude and GPT models.

2. **Shared Library to Backend**: The TypeScript library communicates with the backend through a RESTful API, handling authentication, data transformation, and error management.

3. **VS Code Extension to Shared Library**: The extension integrates the shared library to communicate with the backend while providing editor-specific functionality.

4. **User Preferences Synchronization**: User preferences can be stored both locally in VS Code settings and in the backend database, with synchronization between them.

5. **Future Integrations**: The architecture is designed for additional client integrations, such as Obsidian and LibreOffice, which would connect to the same backend through the shared library.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Develop a second connector for Obsidian as part of Phase 2
- [ ] Enhance the Core Service with more sophisticated prompt engineering
- [ ] Improve handling of longer documents through chunking
- [ ] Implement more advanced user preference options
- [ ] Add versioning strategy for the API to support future enhancements
- [ ] Explore integration with external grammar checking tools

## Reflections
The integration-first approach proved to be a strong design choice. By bringing AI capabilities directly into users' existing writing environments, we eliminate context switching and provide a seamless experience.

The layered architecture with a shared connector library was particularly effective, as it allows for code reuse across different client integrations while maintaining a consistent interface to the backend.

Manual testing of the VS Code extension revealed several edge cases that needed addressing, particularly around error handling and keyboard shortcuts. These have been fixed, resulting in a more robust user experience.

The decision to use OpenRouter for LLM access provides great flexibility, allowing users to choose from various models based on their preferences and requirements.
